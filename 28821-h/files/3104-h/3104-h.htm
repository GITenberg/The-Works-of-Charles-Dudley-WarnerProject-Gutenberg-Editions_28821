    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was near midnight: The company gathered in a famous city studio were
      under the impression, diligently diffused in the world, that the end of
      the century is a time of license if not of decadence. The situation had
      its own piquancy, partly in the surprise of some of those assembled at
      finding themselves in bohemia, partly in a flutter of expectation of
      seeing something on the border-line of propriety. The hour, the place, the
      anticipation of the lifting of the veil from an Oriental and ancient art,
      gave them a titillating feeling of adventure, of a moral hazard bravely
      incurred in the duty of knowing life, penetrating to its core. Opportunity
      for this sort of fruitful experience being rare outside the metropolis,
      students of good and evil had made the pilgrimage to this midnight
      occasion from less-favored cities. Recondite scholars in the physical
      beauty of the Greeks, from Boston, were there; fair women from Washington,
      whose charms make the reputation of many a newspaper correspondent;
      spirited stars of official and diplomatic life, who have moments of
      longing to shine in some more languorous material paradise, had made a
      hasty flitting to be present at the ceremony, sustained by a slight
      feeling of bravado in making this exceptional descent. But the favored
      hundred spectators were mainly from the city-groups of late diners, who
      fluttered in under that pleasurable glow which the red Jacqueminot always
      gets from contiguity with the pale yellow Clicquot; theatre parties, a
      little jaded, and quite ready for something real and stimulating; men from
      the clubs and men from studios&mdash;representatives of society and of art
      graciously mingled, since it is discovered that it is easier to make art
      fashionable than to make fashion artistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast, dimly lighted apartment was itself mysterious, a temple of
      luxury quite as much as of art. Shadows lurked in the corners, the ribs of
      the roof were faintly outlined; on the sombre walls gleams of color, faces
      of loveliness and faces of pain, studies all of a mood or a passion, bits
      of shining brass, reflections from lustred ware struggling out of
      obscurity; hangings from Fez or Tetuan, bits of embroidery, costumes in
      silk and in velvet, still having the aroma of balls a hundred years ago,
      the faint perfume of a scented society of ladies and gallants; a skeleton
      scarcely less fantastic than the draped wooden model near it; heavy rugs
      of Daghestan and Persia, making the footfalls soundless on the floor; a
      fountain tinkling in a thicket of japonicas and azaleas; the stems of
      palmettoes, with their branches waving in the obscurity overhead; points
      of light here and there where a shaded lamp shone on a single red rose in
      a blue Granada vase on a toppling stand, or on a mass of jonquils in a
      barbarous pot of Chanak-Kallessi; tacked here and there on walls and
      hangings, colored memoranda of Capri and of the North Woods, the armor of
      knights, trophies of small-arms, crossed swords of the Union and the
      Confederacy, easels, paints, and palettes, and rows of canvases leaning
      against the wall-the studied litter, in short, of a successful artist,
      whose surroundings contribute to the popular conception of his genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wall at one end of the apartment was stretched a white canvas; in
      front of it was left a small cleared space, on the edge of which, in the
      shadow, squatting on the floor, were four swarthy musicians in Oriental
      garments, with a mandolin, a guitar, a ney, and a darabooka drum. About
      this cleared space, in a crescent, knelt or sat upon the rugs a couple of
      rows of men in evening dress; behind them, seated in chairs, a group of
      ladies, whose white shoulders and arms and animated faces flashed out in
      the semi-obscurity; and in their rear stood a crowd of spectators&mdash;beautiful
      young gentlemen with vacant faces and the elevated Oxford shoulders, rosy
      youth already blase to all this world can offer, and gray-headed men young
      again in the prospect of a new sensation. So they kneel or stand,
      worshipers before the shrine, expecting the advent of the Goddess of
      AEsthetic Culture.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0013}.jpg" alt="{0013}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0013}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      The moment has come. There is a tap on the drum, a tuning of the strings,
      a flash of light from the rear of the room inundates the white canvas, and
      suddenly a figure is poised in the space, her shadow cast upon the glowing
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the Spanish dancer!
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparition evokes a flutter of applause. It is a superb figure, clad
      in a high tight bodice and long skirts simply draped so as to show every
      motion of the athletic limbs. She seems, in this pose and light,
      supernaturally tall. Through her parted lips white teeth gleam, and she
      smiles. Is it a smile of anticipated, triumph, or of contempt? Is it the
      smile of the daughter of Herodias, or the invitation of a &lsquo;ghazeeyeh&rsquo;? She
      pauses. Shall she surprise, or shock, or only please? What shall the art
      that is older than the pyramids do for these kneeling Christians? The drum
      taps, the ney pipes, the mandolin twangs, her arms are extended&mdash;the
      castanets clink, a foot is thrust out, the bosom heaves, the waist
      trembles. What shall it be&mdash;the old serpent dance of the Nile, or the
      posturing of decorous courtship when the olives are purple in the time of
      the grape harvest? Her head, wreathed with coils of black hair, a red rose
      behind the left ear, is thrown back. The eyes flash, there is a snakelike
      movement of the limbs, the music hastens slowly in unison with the
      quickening pulse, the body palpitates, seems to flash invitation like the
      eyes, it turns, it twists, the neck is thrust forward, it is drawn in,
      while the limbs move still slowly, tentatively; suddenly the body from the
      waist up seems to twist round, with the waist as a pivot, in a flash of
      athletic vigor, the music quickens, the arms move more rapidly to the
      click of the heated castenets, the steps are more pronounced, the whole
      woman is agitated, bounding, pulsing with physical excitement. It is a
      Maenad in an access of gymnastic energy. Yes, it is gymnastics; it is not
      grace; it is scarcely alluring. Yet it is a physical triumph. While the
      spectators are breathless, the fury ceases, the music dies, and the
      Spaniard sinks into a chair, panting with triumph, and inclines her dark
      head to the clapping of hands and the bravos. The kneelers rise; the
      spectators break into chattering groups; the ladies look at the dancer
      with curious eyes; a young gentleman with the elevated Oxford shoulders
      leans upon the arm of her chair and fans her. The pose is correct; it is
      the somewhat awkward tribute of culture to physical beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be on speaking terms with the phenomenon was for the moment a
      distinction. The young ladies wondered if it would be proper to go forward
      and talk with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said a wit. &ldquo;The Duke of Donnycastle always shakes hands with
      the pugilists at a mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so bad&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker was a Washington beauty in an evening
      dress that she would have condemned as indecorous for the dancer it is not
      so bad as I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Expected?&rdquo; asked her companion, a sedate man of thirty-five, with the
      cynical air of a student of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I feared,&rdquo; she added, quickly. &ldquo;I have always had a curiosity to know
      what these Oriental dances mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing in particular, now. This was an exhibition dance. Of course
      its origin, like all dancing, was religious. The fault I find with it is
      that it lacks seriousness, like the modern exhibition of the dancing
      dervishes for money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Mavick, that the decay of dancing is the reason our
      religion lacks seriousness? We are in Lent now, you know. Does this seem
      to you a Lenten performance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, to a degree. Anything that keeps you up till three o&rsquo;clock in
      the morning has some penitential quality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me a new view, Mr. Mavick. I confess that I did not expect to
      assist at what New Englanders call an &lsquo;evening meeting.&rsquo; I thought Eros
      was the deity of the dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, Mrs. Lamon, is a vulgar error. It is an ancient form of worship.
      Virtue and beauty are the same thing&mdash;the two graces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a nice apothegm! It makes religion so easy and agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As easy as gravitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, Mr. Mavick, I thought this was a question of levitation. You are
      upsetting all my ideas. I shall not have the comfort of repenting of this
      episode in Lent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; you can be sorry that the dancing was not more alluring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime there was heard the popping of corks. Venetian glasses filled
      with champagne were quaffed under the blessing of sparkling eyes, young
      girls, almond-eyed for the occasion, in the costume of Tokyo, handed round
      ices, and the hum of accelerated conversation filled the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your wife didn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Jack Delancy, with a little bow, before he raised his
      glass. And then added, &ldquo;Her taste isn&rsquo;t for this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl, already flushed with the wine, blushed a little&mdash;Jack
      thought he had never seen her look so dazzlingly handsome&mdash;as she
      said, &ldquo;And you think mine is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, no, I didn&rsquo;t mean that; that is, you know&rdquo;&mdash;Jack didn&rsquo;t
      exactly see his way out of the dilemma&mdash;&ldquo;Edith is a little
      old-fashioned; but what&rsquo;s the harm in this, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say there was any,&rdquo; she replied, with a smile at his
      embarrassment. &ldquo;Only I think there are half a dozen women in the room who
      could do it better, with a little practice. It isn&rsquo;t as Oriental as I
      thought it would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say as to that. I know Edith thinks I&rsquo;ve gone into the depths of
      the Orient. But, on the whole, I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;&rdquo; Jack stopped on the verge
      of speaking out of his better nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t be rude again. I quite understand that she is not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dialogue was cut short by a clapping of hands. The spectators took
      their places again, the lights were lowered, the illumination was turned
      on the white canvas, and the dancer, warmed with wine and adulation, took
      a bolder pose, and, as her limbs began to move, sang a wild Moorish melody
      in a shrill voice, action and words flowing together into the passion of
      the daughter of tents in a desert life. It was all vigorous, suggestive,
      more properly religious, Mavick would have said, and the applause was
      vociferous.
    </p>
    <p>
      More wine went about. There was another dance, and then another, a slow
      languid movement, half melancholy and full of sorrow, if one might say
      that of a movement, for unrepented sin; a gypsy dance this, accompanied by
      the mournful song of Boabdil, &ldquo;The Last Sigh of the Moor.&rdquo; And suddenly,
      when the feelings of the spectators were melted to tender regret, a flash
      out of all this into a joyous defiance, a wooing of pleasure with smiling
      lips and swift feet, with the clash of cymbals and the quickened throb of
      the drum. And so an end with the dawn of a new day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet dawn, however, for the clocks were only striking three as
      the assembly, in winter coats and soft wraps, fluttered out to its
      carriages, chattering and laughing, with endless good-nights in the
      languages of France, Germany, and Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were as nearly deserted as they ever are; here and there a
      lumbering market-wagon from Jersey, an occasional street-car with its
      tinkling bell, rarer still the rush of a trembling train on the elevated,
      the voice of a belated reveler, a flitting female figure at a street
      corner, the roll of a livery hack over the ragged pavement. But mainly the
      noise of the town was hushed, and in the sharp air the stars, far off and
      uncontaminated, glowed with a pure lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther up town it was quite still, and in one of the noble houses in the
      neighborhood of the Park sat Edith Delancy, married not quite a year,
      listening for the roll of wheels and the click of a night-key.

    <p>
      Everybody liked John Corlear Delancy, and this in spite of himself, for no
      one ever knew him to make any effort to incur either love or hate. The
      handsome boy was a favorite without lifting his eyebrows, and he sauntered
      through the university, picking his easy way along an elective course,
      winning the affectionate regard of every one with whom he came in contact.
      And this was not because he lacked quality, or was merely easy-going and
      negative or effeminate, for the same thing happened to him when he went
      shooting in the summer in the Rockies. The cowboys and the severe
      moralists of the plains, whose sedate business in life is to get the drop
      on offensive persons, regarded him as a brother. It isn&rsquo;t a bad test of
      personal quality, this power to win the loyalty of men who have few or
      none of the conventional virtues. These non-moral enforcers of justice&mdash;as
      they understood it liked Jack exactly as his friends in the New York clubs
      liked him&mdash;and perhaps the moral standard of approval of the one was
      as good as the other.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0021}.jpg" alt="{0021}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0021}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Jack was a very good shot and a fair rider, and in the climate of England
      he might have taken first-rate rank in athletics. But he had never taken
      first-rate rank in anything, except good-fellowship. He had a great many
      expensive tastes, which he could not afford to indulge, except in
      imagination. The luxury of a racing-stable, or a yacht, or a library of
      scarce books bound by Paris craftsmen was denied him. Those who account
      for failures in life by a man&rsquo;s circumstances, and not by a lack in the
      man himself, which is always the secret of failure, said that Jack was
      unfortunate in coming into a certain income of twenty thousand a year.
      This was just enough to paralyze effort, and not enough to permit a man to
      expand in any direction. It is true that he was related to millions and
      moved in a millionaire atmosphere, but these millions might never flow
      into his bank account. They were not in hand to use, and they also helped
      to paralyze effort&mdash;like black clouds of an impending shower that may
      pass around, but meantime keeps the watcher indoors.

      The best thing that Jack Delancy ever did, for himself, was to marry Edith
      Fletcher. The wedding, which took place some eight months before the
      advent of the Spanish dancer, was a surprise to many, for the girl had
      even less fortune than Jack, and though in and of his society entirely,
      was supposed to have ideals. Her family, indeed, was an old one on the
      island, and was prominent long before the building of the stone bridge on
      Canal Street over the outlet of Collect Pond. Those who knew Edith well
      detected in her that strain of moral earnestness which made the old
      Fletchers such stanch and trusty citizens. The wonder was not that Jack,
      with his easy susceptibility to refined beauty, should have been attracted
      to her, or have responded to a true instinct of what was best for him, but
      that Edith should have taken up with such a perfect type of the
      aimlessness of the society strata of modern life. The wonder, however, was
      based upon a shallow conception of the nature of woman. It would have been
      more wonderful if the qualities that endeared Jack to college friends and
      club men, to the mighty sportsmen who do not hesitate, in the clubs, to
      devastate Canada and the United States of big game, and to the border
      ruffians of Dakota, should not have gone straight to the tender heart of a
      woman of ideals. And when in all history was there a woman who did not
      believe, when her heart went with respect for certain manly traits, that
      she could inspire and lift a man into a noble life?
    </p>
    <p>
      The silver clock in the breakfast-room was striking ten, and Edith was
      already seated at the coffee-urn, when Jack appeared. She was as fresh as
      a rose, and greeted him with a bright smile as he came behind her chair
      and bent over for the morning kiss&mdash;a ceremony of affection which, if
      omitted, would have left a cloud on the day for both of them, and which
      Jack always declared was simply a necessity, or the coffee would have no
      flavor. But when a man has picked a rose, it is always a sort of climax
      which is followed by an awkward moment, and Jack sat down with the air of
      a man who has another day to get through with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you amused with the dancing&mdash;this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; said Jack, sipping his coffee. &ldquo;It was a stunning place for it,
      that studio; you&rsquo;d have liked that. The Lamons and Mavick and a lot of
      people from the provinces were there. The company was more fun than the
      dance, especially to a fellow who has seen how good it can be and how bad
      in its home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a chance to see the Spanish dancer again, under proper
      auspices,&rdquo; said Edith, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are invited by Mrs. Brown&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother of the Bible class at St. Philip&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;to attend a charity performance for the benefit of the Female
      Waifs&rsquo; Refuge. She is to dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Mrs. Brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith paid no attention to this impertinence. &ldquo;They are to make an
      artificial evening at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must have got hold of Mavick&rsquo;s notion that this dance is religious
      in its origin. Do you, know if the exercises will open with prayer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Jack. You know I don&rsquo;t intend to go. I shall send a small
      check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, draw it mild. But isn&rsquo;t this what I&rsquo;m accused of doing&mdash;shirking
      my duty of personal service by a contribution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But you didn&rsquo;t have any of that shirking feeling last night, did
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack laughed, and ran round to give the only reply possible to such a
      gibe. These breakfast interludes had not lost piquancy in all these
      months. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half a mind to go to this thing. I would, if it didn&rsquo;t break
      up my day so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this morning I have to go up to the riding-school to see a horse&mdash;Storm;
      I want to try him. And then I have to go down to Twist&rsquo;s and see a lot of
      Japanese drawings he&rsquo;s got over. Do you know that the birds and other
      animals those beggars have been drawing, which we thought were
      caricatures, are the real thing? They have eyes sharp enough to see things
      in motion&mdash;flying birds and moving horses which we never caught till
      we put the camera on them. Awfully curious. Then I shall step into the
      club a minute, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be in at lunch? Bess is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait lunch. I&rsquo;ve a lot to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith followed him with her eyes, a little wistfully; she heard the outer
      door close, and still sat at the table, turning over the pile of notes at
      her plate, and thinking of many things&mdash;things that it began to dawn
      upon her mind could not be done, and things of immediate urgency that must
      be done. Life did not seem quite such a simple problem to her as it had
      looked a year ago. That there is nothing like experiment to clear the
      vision is the general idea, but oftener it is experience that perplexes.
      Indeed, Edith was thinking that some things seemed much easier to her
      before she had tried them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat at the table with a faultless morning-gown, with a bunch of
      English violets in her bosom, an artist could have desired no better
      subject. Many people thought her eyes her best feature; they were large
      brown eyes, yet not always brown, green at times, liquid, but never
      uncertain, apt to have a smile in them, yet their chief appealing
      characteristic was trustfulness, a pure sort of steadfastness, that always
      conveyed the impression of a womanly personal interest in the person upon
      whom they were fixed. They were eyes that haunted one like a remembered
      strain of music. The lips were full, and the mouth was drawn in such
      exquisite lines that it needed the clear-cut and emphasized chin to give
      firmness to its beauty. The broad forehead, with arching eyebrows, gave an
      intellectual cast to a face the special stamp of which was purity. The
      nose, with thin open nostrils, a little too strong for beauty, together
      with the chin, gave the impression of firmness and courage; but the
      wonderful eyes, the inviting mouth, so modified this that the total
      impression was that of high spirit and great sweetness of character. It
      was the sort of face from which one might expect passionate love or
      unflinching martyrdom. Her voice had a quality the memory of which
      lingered longer even than the expression of her eyes; it was low, and, as
      one might say, a fruity voice, not quite clear, though sweet, as if veiled
      in femineity. This note of royal womanhood was also in her figure, a
      little more than medium in height, and full of natural grace. Somehow
      Edith, with all these good points, had not the reputation of a belle or a
      beauty&mdash;perhaps for want of some artificial splendor&mdash;but one
      could not be long in her company without feeling that she had great charm,
      without which beauty becomes insipid and even commonplace, and with which
      the plainest woman is attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith&rsquo;s theory of life, if one may so dignify the longings of a young
      girl, had been very simple, and not at all such as would be selected by
      the heroine of a romance. She had no mission, nor was she afflicted by
      that modern form of altruism which is a yearning for notoriety by
      conspicuous devotion to causes and reforms quite outside her normal sphere
      of activity. A very sincere person, with strong sympathy for humanity
      tempered by a keen perception of the humorous side of things, she had a
      purpose, perhaps not exactly formulated, of making the most out of her own
      life, not in any outward and shining career, but by a development of
      herself in the most helpful and harmonious relations to her world. And it
      seemed to her, though she had never philosophized it, that a marriage such
      as she believed she had made was the woman&rsquo;s way to the greatest happiness
      and usefulness. In this she followed the dictates of a clear mind and a
      warm heart. If she had reasoned about it, considering how brief life is,
      and how small can be any single contribution to a better social condition,
      she might have felt more strongly the struggle against nature, and the
      false position involved in the new idea that marriage is only a kind of
      occupation, instead of an ordinance decreed in the very constitution of
      the human race. With the mere instinct of femineity she saw the falseness
      of the assumption that the higher life for man or woman lies in separate
      and solitary paths through the wilderness of this world. To an intelligent
      angel, seated on the arch of the heavens, the spectacle of the latter-day
      pseudo-philosophic and economic dribble about the doubtful expediency of
      having a wife, and the failure of marriage, must seem as ludicrous as
      would a convention of birds or of flowers reasoning that the processes of
      nature had continued long enough. Edith was simply a natural woman, who
      felt rather than reasoned that in a marriage such as her heart approved
      she should make the most of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she sat here this morning this did not seem to be so simple a
      matter as it had appeared. It began to be suspected that in order to make
      the most of one&rsquo;s self it was necessary to make the most of many other
      persons and things. The stream in its own channel flowed along not without
      vexations, friction and foaming and dashings from bank to bank; but it
      became quite another and a more difficult movement when it was joined to
      another stream, with its own currents and eddies and impetuosities and
      sluggishness, constantly liable to be deflected if not put altogether on
      another course. Edith was not putting it in this form as she turned over
      her notes of invitation and appointments and engagements, but simply
      wondering where the time for her life was to come in, and for Jack&rsquo;s life,
      which occupied a much larger space than it seemed to occupy in the days
      before it was joined to hers. Very curious this discovery of what
      another&rsquo;s life really is. Of course the society life must go on, that had
      always gone on, for what purpose no one could tell, only it was the
      accepted way of disposing of time; and now there were the dozen ways in
      which she was solicited to show her interest in those supposed to be less
      fortunate in life than herself-the alleviation of the miseries of her own
      city. And with society, and charity, and sympathy with the working
      classes, and her own reading, and a little drawing and painting, for which
      she had some talent, what became of that comradeship with Jack, that union
      of interests and affections, which was to make her life altogether so high
      and sweet?
    </p>
    <p>
      This reverie, which did not last many minutes, and was interrupted by the
      abrupt moving away of Edith to the writing-desk in her own room, was
      caused by a moment&rsquo;s vivid realization of what Jack&rsquo;s interests in life
      were. Could she possibly make them her own? And if she did, what would
      become of her own ideals?

    </h2>
    <p>
      It was indeed a busy day for Jack. Great injustice would be done him if it
      were supposed that he did not take himself and his occupations seriously.
      His mind was not disturbed by trifles. He knew that he had on the right
      sort of four-in-hand necktie, with the appropriate pin of pear-shaped
      pearl, and that he carried the cane of the season. These things come by a
      sort of social instinct, are in the air, as it were, and do not much tax
      the mind. He had to hasten a little to keep his half-past-eleven o&rsquo;clock
      appointment at Stalker&rsquo;s stables, and when he arrived several men of his
      set were already waiting, who were also busy men, and had made a little
      effort to come round early and assist Jack in making up his mind about the
      horse.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0033}.jpg" alt="{0033}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0033}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      When Mr. Stalker brought out Storm, and led him around to show his action,
      the connoisseurs took on a critical attitude, an attitude of judgment,
      exhibited not less in the poise of the head and the serious face than in
      the holding of the cane and the planting of legs wide apart. And the
      attitude had a refined nonchalance which professional horsemen scarcely
      ever attain. Storm could not have received more critical and serious
      attention if he had been a cooked terrapin. He could afford to stand this
      scrutiny, and he seemed to move about with the consciousness that he knew
      more about being a horse than his judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Storm was, in fact, a splendid animal, instinct with life from his thin
      flaring nostril to his small hoof; black as a raven, his highly groomed
      skin took the polish of ebony, and showed the play of his powerful
      muscles, and, one might say, almost the nervous currents that thrilled his
      fine texture. His large, bold eyes, though not wicked, flamed now and then
      with an energy and excitement that gave ample notice that he would obey no
      master who had not stronger will and nerve than his own. It was a tribute
      to Jack&rsquo;s manliness that, when he mounted him for a turn in the ring,
      Storm seemed to recognize the fine quality of both seat and hand, and
      appeared willing to take him on probation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got good points,&rdquo; said Mr. Herbert Albert Flick, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d like a
      straighter back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be hanged, though, Jack,&rdquo; was Mr. Mowbray Russell&rsquo;s comment, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d
      ride him in the Park before he&rsquo;s docked. Say what you like about action, a
      horse has got to have style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moves easy, falls off a little too much to suit me in the quarter,&rdquo;
       suggested Mr. Pennington Docstater, sucking the head of his cane. &ldquo;How
      about his staying quality, Stalker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where he is, Mr. Docstater; take him on the road, he&rsquo;s a
      stayer for all day. Goes like a bird. He&rsquo;ll take you along at the rate of
      nine miles in forty-five minutes as long as you want to sit there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump?&rdquo; queried little Bobby Simerton, whose strong suit at the club was
      talking about meets and hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never refused anything I put him at,&rdquo; replied Stalker; &ldquo;takes every fence
      as if it was the regular thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0037}.jpg" alt="{0037}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0037}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Storm was in this way entirely taken to pieces, praised and disparaged, in
      a way to give Stalker, it might be inferred from his manner, a high
      opinion of the knowledge of these young gentlemen. &ldquo;It takes a gentleman,&rdquo;
       in fact, Stalker said, &ldquo;to judge a hoss, for a good hoss is a gentleman
      himself.&rdquo; It was much discussed whether Storm would do better for the Park
      or for the country, whether it would be better to put him in the field or
      keep him for a roadster. It might, indeed, be inferred that Jack had not
      made up his mind whether he should buy a horse for use in the Park or for
      country riding. Even more than this might be inferred from the long
      morning&rsquo;s work, and that was that while Jack&rsquo;s occupation was to buy a
      horse, if he should buy one his occupation would be gone. He was known at
      the club to be looking for the right sort of a horse, and that he knew
      what he wanted, and was not easily satisfied; and as long as he occupied
      this position he was an object of interest to sellers and to his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Mr. Stalker understood this, for when the buyers had gone he
      remarked to the stable-boy, &ldquo;Mr. Delancy, he don&rsquo;t want to buy no hoss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the inspection of the horse was finished it was time for lunch, and
      the labors of the morning were felt to justify this indulgence, though
      each of the party had other engagements, and was too busy to waste the
      time. They went down to the Knickerbocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lunch was slight, but its ordering took time and consideration, as it
      ought, for nothing is so destructive of health and mental tone as the
      snatching of a mid-day meal at a lunch counter from a bill of fare
      prepared by God knows whom. Mr. Russell said that if it took time to buy a
      horse, it ought to take at least equal time and care to select the fodder
      that was to make a human being wretched or happy. Indeed, a man who didn&rsquo;t
      give his mind to what he ate wouldn&rsquo;t have any mind by-and-by to give to
      anything. This sentiment had the assent of the table, and was illustrated
      by varied personal experience; and a deep feeling prevailed, a serious
      feeling, that in ordering and eating the right sort of lunch a chief duty
      of a useful day had been discharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be imagined from this, however, that the conversation was
      about trifles. Business men and operators could have learned something
      about stocks and investments, and politicians about city politics.
      Mademoiselle Vivienne, the new skirt dancer, might have been surprised at
      the intimate tone in which she was alluded to, but she could have got some
      useful hints in effects, for her judges were cosmopolitans who had seen
      the most suggestive dancing in all parts of the world. It came out
      incidentally that every one at table had been &ldquo;over&rdquo; in the course of the
      season, not for any general purpose, not as a sightseer, but to look at
      somebody&rsquo;s stables, or to attend a wedding, or a sale of etchings, or to
      see his bootmaker, or for a little shooting in Scotland, just as one might
      run down to Bar Harbor or Tuxedo. It was only an incident in a busy
      season; and one of the fruits of it appeared to be as perfect a knowledge
      of the comparative merits of all the ocean racers and captains as of the
      English and American stables and the trainers. One not informed of the
      progress of American life might have been surprised to see that the fad is
      to be American, with a sort of patronage of things and ways foreign,
      especially of things British, a large continental kind of attitude,
      begotten of hearing much about Western roughing it, of Alaska, of
      horse-breeding and fruit-raising on the Pacific, of the Colorado River
      Canon. As for stuffs, well yes, London. As for style, you can&rsquo;t mistake a
      man who is dressed in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine was a white Riesling from California. Docstater said his
      attention had been called to it by Tom Dillingham at the Union, who had a
      ranch somewhere out there. It was declared to be sound and palatable; you
      know what you are drinking. This led to a learned discussion of the future
      of American wines, and a patriotic impulse was given to the trade by
      repeated orders. It was declared that in American wines lay the solution
      of the temperance question. Bobby Simerton said that Burgundy was good
      enough for him, but Russell put him down, as he saw the light yellow
      through his glass, by the emphatic affirmation that plenty of cheap
      American well-made wine would knock the bottom out of all the sentimental
      temperance societies and shut up the saloons, dry up all those not limited
      to light wines and beer. It was agreed that the saloons would have to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      This satisfactory conclusion was reached before the coffee came on and the
      cigarettes, and the sound quality of the Riesling was emphasized by a pony
      of cognac.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is fortunate when the youth of a country have an ideal. No nation is
      truly great without a common ideal, capable of evoking enthusiasm and
      calling out its energies. And where are we to look for this if not in the
      youth, and especially in those to whom fortune and leisure give an
      opportunity of leadership? It is they who can inspire by their example,
      and by their pursuits attract others to a higher conception of the
      national life. It may take the form of patriotism, as in this country,
      pride in the great republic, jealousy of its honor and credit, eagerness
      for its commanding position among the nations, patriotism which will show
      itself, in all the ardor of believing youth, in the administration of law,
      in the purity of politics, in honest local government, and in a noble
      aspiration for the glory of the country. It may take the form of culture,
      of a desire that the republic-liable, like all self-made nations, to
      worship wealth-should be distinguished not so much by a vulgar national
      display as by an advance in the arts, the sciences, the education that
      adorns life, in the noble spirit of humanity, and in the nobler spirit of
      recognition of a higher life, which will be content with no civilization
      that does not tend to make the country for every citizen a better place to
      live in today than it was yesterday. Happy is the country, happy the
      metropolis of that country, whose fortunate young men have this high
      conception of citizenship!

      What is the ideal of their country which these young men cherish? There

      and in a passion of devotion they were eager&mdash;were they not?&mdash;to
      follow the flag and to give their brief lives to its imperishable glory.
      Nothing is impossible to a nation with an ideal like that. It was this
      flame that ran over Europe in the struggle of France against a world in
      arms. It was this national ideal that was incarnate in Napoleon, as every
      great idea that moves the world is sooner or later incarnated. What was it
      that we saw in Washington on his knees at Valley Forge, or blazing with
      wrath at the cowardice on Monmouth? in Lincoln entering Richmond with
      bowed head and infinite sorrow and yearning in his heart? An embodiment of
      a great national idea and destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France this ideal burns yet like a flame, and is still evoked by a
      name. It is the passion of glory, but the desire of a nation, and Napoleon
      was the incarnation of passion. They say that he is not dead as others are
      dead, but that he may come again and ride at the head of his legions, and
      strike down the enemies of France; that his bugle will call the youth from
      every hamlet, that the roll of his drum will transform France into a camp,
      and the grenadiers will live again and ride with him, amid hurrahs, and
      streaming tears, and shouts of &ldquo;My Emperor! Oh, my Emperor!&rdquo; Is it only a
      legend? But the spirit is there; not a boy but dreams of it, not a girl
      but knots the thought in with her holiday tricolor. That is to have an
      abiding ideal, and patiently to hold it, in isolation, in defeat, even in
      an overripe civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe&mdash;do we not?&mdash;in other triumphs than those of the drum
      and the sword. Our aspirations for the republic are for a nobler example
      of human society than the world has yet seen. Happy is the country, and
      the metropolis of the country, whose youth, gilded only by their virtues,
      have these aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the party broke up, the street lamps were beginning to twinkle here
      and there, and Jack discovered to his surprise that the Twiss business
      would have to go over to another day. It was such a hurrying life in New
      York. There was just time for a cup of tea at Mrs. Trafton&rsquo;s. Everybody
      dropped in there after five o&rsquo;clock, when the duties of the day were over,
      with the latest news, and to catch breath before rushing into the program
      of the evening.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0047}.jpg" alt="{0047}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0047}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      There were a dozen ladies in the drawing-room when Jack entered, and his
      first impression was that the scream of conversation would be harder to
      talk against than a Wagner opera; but he presently got his cup of tea, and
      found a snug seat in the chimney-corner by Miss Tavish; indeed, they moved
      to it together, and so got a little out of the babel. Jack thought the
      girl looked even prettier in her walking-dress than when he saw her at the
      studio; she had style, there was no doubt about that; and then, while
      there was no invitation in her manner, one felt that she was a woman to
      whom one could easily say things, and who was liable at any moment to say
      things interesting herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your first appearance since last night, Mr. Delancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; I&rsquo;ve been racing about on errands all day. It is very restful to
      sit down by a calm person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never shut my eyes till nine o&rsquo;clock. I kept seeing that Spanish
      woman whirl around and contort, and&mdash;do you mind my telling you?&mdash;I
      couldn&rsquo;t just help it, I&rdquo; (leaning forward to Jack) &ldquo;got up and tried it
      before the glass. There! Are you shocked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much shocked as excluded,&rdquo; Jack dared to say. &ldquo;But do you think&mdash;&ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. There isn&rsquo;t anything that an American girl cannot do. I&rsquo;ve
      made up my mind to try it. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t flatter yourself. Only girls. I don&rsquo;t want men
      around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; said Jack, honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Tavish laughed. &ldquo;You are too forward, Mr. Delancy. Perhaps some time,
      when we have learned, we will let in a few of you, to look in at the door,
      fifty dollars a ticket, for some charity. I don&rsquo;t see why dancing isn&rsquo;t
      just as good an accomplishment as playing the harp in a Greek dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do I; I&rsquo;d rather see it. Besides, you&rsquo;ve got Scripture warrant for
      dancing off the heads of people. And then it is such a sweet way of doing
      a charity. Dancing for the East Side is the best thing I have heard yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t mock. You won&rsquo;t when you find out what it costs you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you two plotting?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Trafton, coming across to the
      fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charity,&rdquo; said Jack, meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife was here this morning to get me to go and see some of her
      friends in Hester Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not today. It&rsquo;s awfully interesting, but I&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edith seems to be devoted to that sort of thing,&rdquo; remarked Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, slowly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got the idea that sympathy is better than
      money; she says she wants to try to understand other people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness knows, I&rsquo;d like to understand my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And were you trying, Mr. Delancy, to persuade Miss Tavish into that sort
      of charity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;I was trying to interest the East End in
      something, for the benefit of Miss Tavish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that&rsquo;s one of the most expensive remarks you ever made,&rdquo;
       retorted Miss Tavish, rising to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Lily Tavish would marry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Trafton, watching the girl&rsquo;s
      slender figure as it passed through the portiere; &ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t know what
      to do with herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;d be a lovely wife for somebody;&rdquo;
       and then he added, as if reminiscently, &ldquo;if he could afford it. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a fashion of talking. I never knew a time when so many people
      afforded to do what they wanted to do. But you men are all alike.
      Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Jack reached home it was only a little after six o&rsquo;clock, and as they
      were not to go out to dine till eight, he had a good hour to rest from the
      fatigues of the day, and run over the evening papers and dip into the
      foreign periodicals to catch a topic or two for the dinner-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the maid, &ldquo;Mrs. Delancy came in an hour ago.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Edith&rsquo;s day had been as busy as Jack&rsquo;s, notwithstanding she had put aside
      several things that demanded her attention. She denied herself the morning
      attendance on the Literature Class that was raking over the eighteenth
      century. This week Swift was to be arraigned. The last time when Edith was
      present it was Steele. The judgment, on the whole, had been favorable, and
      there had been a little stir of tenderness among the bonnets over
      Thackeray&rsquo;s comments on the Christian soldier. It seemed to bring him near
      to them. &ldquo;Poor Dick Steele!&rdquo; said the essayist. Edith declared afterwards
      that the large woman who sat next to her, Mrs. Jerry Hollowell, whispered
      to her that she always thought his name was Bessemer; but this was, no
      doubt, a pleasantry. It was a beautiful essay, and so stimulating! And
      then there was bouillon, and time to look about at the toilets. Poor
      Steele, it would have cheered his life to know that a century after his
      death so many beautiful women, so exquisitely dressed, would have been
      concerning themselves about him. The function lasted two hours. Edith made
      a little calculation. In five minutes she could have got from the
      encyclopaedia all the facts in the essay, and while her maid was doing her
      hair she could have read five times as much of Steele as the essayist
      read. And, somehow, she was not stimulated, for the impression seemed to
      prevail that now Steele was disposed of. And she had her doubts whether
      literature would, after all, prove to be a permanent social distraction.
      But Edith may have been too severe in her judgment. There was probably not
      a woman in the class that day who did not go away with the knowledge that
      Steele was an author, and that he lived in the eighteenth century. The
      hope for the country is in the diffusion of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the class to take care of Swift, Edith went to the managers&rsquo;
      meeting at the Women&rsquo;s Hospital, where there was much to do of very
      practical work, pitiful cases of women and children suffering through no
      fault of their own, and money more difficult to raise than sympathy. The
      meeting took time and thought. Dismissing her carriage, and relying on
      elevated and surface cars, Edith then took a turn on the East Side, in
      company with a dispensary physician whose daily duty called her into the
      worst parts of the town. She had a habit of these tours before her
      marriage, and, though they were discouragingly small in direct results,
      she gained a knowledge of city life that was of immense service in her
      general charity work. Jack had suggested the danger of these excursions,
      but she had told him that a woman was less liable to insult in the East
      Side than in Fifth Avenue, especially at twilight, not because the East
      Side was a nice quarter of the city, but because it was accustomed to see
      women who minded their own business go about unattended, and the prowlers
      had not the habit of going there. She could even relate cases of
      chivalrous protection of &ldquo;ladies&rdquo; in some of the worst streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Edith saw this day, open to be seen, was not so much sin as ignorance
      of how to live, squalor, filthy surroundings acquiesced in as the natural
      order, wonderful patience in suffering and deprivation, incapacity,
      ill-paid labor, the kindest spirit of sympathy and helpfulness of the poor
      for each other. Perhaps that which made the deepest impression on her was
      the fact that such conditions of living could seem natural to those in
      them, and that they could get so much enjoyment of life in situations that
      would have been simple misery to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors were in a foreign city. The shop signs were in foreign
      tongues; in some streets all Hebrew. On chance news-stands were displayed
      newspapers in Russian, Bohemian, Arabic, Italian, Hebrew, Polish,
      German-none in English. The theatre bills were in Hebrew or other
      unreadable type. The sidewalks and the streets swarmed with noisy dealers
      in every sort of second-hand merchandise&mdash;vegetables that had seen a
      better day, fish in shoals. It was not easy to make one&rsquo;s way through the
      stands and push-carts and the noisy dickering buyers and sellers, who
      haggled over trifles and chaffed good-naturedly and were strictly intent
      on their own affairs. No part of the town is more crowded or more
      industrious. If youth is the hope of the country, the sight was
      encouraging, for children were in the gutters, on the house steps, at all
      the windows. The houses seemed bursting with humanity, and in nearly every
      room of the packed tenements, whether the inmates were sick or hungry,
      some sort of industry was carried on. In the damp basements were
      junk-dealers, rag-pickers, goose-pickers. In one noisome cellar, off an
      alley, among those sorting rags, was an old woman of eighty-two, who could
      reply to questions only in a jargon, too proud to beg, clinging to life,
      earning a few cents a day in this foul occupation. But life is sweet even
      with poverty and rheumatism and eighty years. Did her dull eyes, turning
      inward, see the Carpathian Hills, a free girlhood in village drudgery and
      village sports, then a romance of love, children, hard work, discontent,
      emigration to a New World of promise? And now a cellar by day, the
      occupation of cutting rags for carpets, and at night a corner in a close
      and crowded room on a flock bed not fit for a dog. And this was a woman&rsquo;s
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picturesque foreign women going about with shawls over their heads and
      usually a bit of bright color somewhere, children at their games, hawkers
      loudly crying their stale wares, the click of sewing-machines heard
      through a broken window, everywhere animation, life, exchange of rough or
      kindly banter. Was it altogether so melancholy as it might seem? Not
      everybody was hopelessly poor, for here were lawyers&rsquo; signs and doctors&rsquo;
      signs&mdash;doctors in whom the inhabitants had confidence because they
      charged all they could get for their services&mdash;and thriving
      pawnbrokers&rsquo; shops. There were parish schools also&mdash;perhaps others;
      and off some dark alley, in a room on the ground-floor, could be heard the
      strident noise of education going on in high-voiced study and recitation.
      Nor were amusements lacking&mdash;notices of balls, dancing this evening,
      and ten-cent shows in palaces of legerdemain and deformity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relenting day in March; patches of blue sky overhead, and the sun
      had some quality in its shining. The children and the caged birds at the
      open windows felt it-and there were notes of music here and there above
      the traffic and the clamor. Turning down a narrow alley, with a gutter in
      the centre, attracted by festive sounds, the visitors came into a small
      stone-paved court with a hydrant in the centre surrounded by tall
      tenement-houses, in the windows of which were stuffed the garments that
      would no longer hold together to adorn the person. Here an Italian girl
      and boy, with a guitar and violin, were recalling la bella Napoli, and a
      couple of pretty girls from the court were footing it as merrily as if it
      were the grape harvest. A woman opened a lower room door and sharply
      called to one of the dancing girls to come in, when Edith and the doctor
      appeared at the bottom of the alley, but her tone changed when she
      recognized the doctor, and she said, by way of apology, that she didn&rsquo;t
      like her daughter to dance before strangers. So the music and the dance
      went on, even little dots of girls and boys shuffling about in a
      stiff-legged fashion, with applause from all the windows, and at last a
      largesse of pennies&mdash;as many as five altogether&mdash;for the
      musicians. And the sun fell lovingly upon the pretty scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then there were the sweaters&rsquo; dens, and the private rooms where half a
      dozen pale-faced tailors stitched and pressed fourteen and sometimes
      sixteen hours a day, stifling rooms, smelling of the hot goose and
      steaming cloth, rooms where they worked, where the cooking was done, where
      they ate, and late at night, when overpowered with weariness, lay down to
      sleep. Struggle for life everywhere, and perhaps no more discontent and
      heart-burning and certainly less ennui than in the palaces on the avenues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The residence of Karl Mulhaus, one of the doctor&rsquo;s patients, was typical
      of the homes of the better class of poor. The apartment fronted on a small
      and not too cleanly court, and was in the third story. As Edith mounted
      the narrow and dark stairways she saw the plan of the house. Four
      apartments opened upon each landing, in which was the common hydrant and
      sink. The Mulhaus apartment consisted of a room large enough to contain a
      bed, a cook-stove, a bureau, a rocking-chair, and two other chairs, and it
      had two small windows, which would have more freely admitted the southern
      sun if they had been washed, and a room adjoining, dark, and nearly filled
      by a big bed. On the walls of the living room were hung highly colored
      advertising chromos of steamships and palaces of industry, and on the
      bureau Edith noticed two illustrated newspapers of the last year, a
      patent-medicine almanac, and a volume of Schiller. The bureau also held
      Mr. Mulhaus&rsquo;s bottles of medicine, a comb which needed a dentist, and a
      broken hair-brush. What gave the room, however, a cheerful aspect were
      some pots of plants on the window-ledges, and half a dozen canary-bird
      cages hung wherever there was room for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the family happened to be at home except Mr. Mulhaus, who occupied
      the rocking-chair, and two children, a girl of four years and a boy of
      eight, who were on the floor playing &ldquo;store&rdquo; with some blocks of wood, a
      few tacks, some lumps of coal, some scraps of paper, and a tangle of
      twine. In their prattle they spoke, the English they had learned from
      their brother who was in a store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel some better today,&rdquo; said Mr. Mulhaus, brightening up as the
      visitors entered, &ldquo;but the cough hangs on. It&rsquo;s three months since this
      weather that I haven&rsquo;t been out, but the birds are a good deal of
      company.&rdquo; He spoke in German, and with effort. He was very thin and
      sallow, and his large feverish eyes added to the pitiful look of his
      refined face. The doctor explained to Edith that he had been getting fair
      wages in a type-foundry until he had become too weak to go any longer to
      the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather hard to have to sit there all day, he explained to the
      doctor, but they were getting along. Mrs. Mulhaus had got a job of
      cleaning that day; that would be fifty cents. Ally&mdash;she was twelve&mdash;was
      learning to sew. That was her afternoon to go to the College Settlement.
      Jimmy, fourteen, had got a place in a store, and earned two dollars a
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Vicky?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Vicky,&rdquo; piped up the eight-year-old boy. &ldquo;Vicky&rsquo;s up to the &lsquo;stution&rdquo;&mdash;the
      hospital was probably the institution referred to&mdash;&ldquo;ever so long now.
      I seen her there, me and Jim did. Such a bootifer place! &lsquo;Nd chicken!&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;Sis got hurt by a cart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vicky was seventeen, and had been in a fancy store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mulhaus, in reply to a question, &ldquo;it pays pretty well raising
      canaries, when they turn out singers. I made fifteen dollars last year. I
      hain&rsquo;t sold much lately. Seems &lsquo;s if people stopped wanting &lsquo;em such
      weather. I guess it &lsquo;ll be better in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt it will be better for the poor fellow himself before spring,&rdquo;
       said the doctor as they made their way down the dirty stairways. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll
      show you one of my favorites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned into a broader street, one of the busy avenues, and passing
      under an archway between two tall buildings, entered a court of back
      buildings. In the third story back lived Aunt Margaret. The room was
      scarcely as big as a ship&rsquo;s cabin, and its one window gave little light,
      for it opened upon a narrow well of high brick walls. In the only chair
      Aunt Margaret was seated close to the window. In front of her was a small
      work-table, with a kerosene lamp on it, but the side of the room towards
      which she looked was quite occupied by a narrow couch&mdash;ridiculously
      narrow, for Aunt Margaret was very stout. There was a thin chest of
      drawers on the other side, and the small coal stove that stood in the
      centre so nearly filled the remaining space that the two visitors were one
      too many.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come in, come in,&rdquo; said the old lady, cheerfully, when the door
      opened. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how goes it?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First rate. I&rsquo;m coming on, doctor. Work&rsquo;s been pretty slack for two weeks
      now, but yesterday I got work for two days. I guess it will be better
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The work was finishing pantaloons. It used to be a good business before
      there was so much cutting in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to get fifteen cents a pair, then ten; now they don&rsquo;t pay but
      five. Yes, the shop furnishes the thread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how many pairs can you finish in a day?&rdquo; asked Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three&mdash;three pairs, to do &lsquo;em nice&mdash;and they are very
      particular&mdash;if I work from six in the morning till twelve at night. I
      could do more, but my sight ain&rsquo;t what it used to be, and I&rsquo;ve broken my
      specs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you earn fifteen cents a day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve the luck to get work, my lady. Sometimes there isn&rsquo;t any. And
      things cost so much. The rent is the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that the rent was two dollars and a half a month. That must be
      paid, at any rate. Edith made a little calculation that on a flush average
      of ninety cents a week earned, and allowing so many cents for coal and so
      many cents for oil, the margin for bread and tea must be small for the
      month. She usually bought three cents&rsquo; worth of tea at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is kinder close,&rdquo; said the old lady, with a smile. &ldquo;The worst is, my
      feet hurt me so I can&rsquo;t stir out. But the neighbors is real kind. The
      little boy next room goes over to the shop and fetches my pantaloons and
      takes &lsquo;em back. I can get along if it don&rsquo;t come slack again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sitting all day by that dim window, half the night stitching by a kerosene
      lamp; lying for six hours on that narrow couch! How to account for this
      old soul&rsquo;s Christian resignation and cheerfulness! &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said the doctor,
      &ldquo;she has seen better days; she has moved in high society; her husband, who
      died twenty years ago, was a policeman. What the old lady is doing is
      fighting for her independence. She has only one fear&mdash;the almshouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was with such scenes as these in her eyes that Edith went to her
      dressing-room to make her toilet for the Henderson dinner.

      It was the first time they had dined with the Hendersons. It was Jack&rsquo;s
      doings. &ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it,&rdquo; Edith had said when the invitation
      came. The unmentioned fact was that Jack had taken a little flier in
      Oshkosh, and a hint from Henderson one evening at the Union, when the
      venture looked squally, had let him out of a heavy loss into a small
      profit, and Jack felt grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how Henderson came to do it?&rdquo; Jack was querying, as he and old
      Fairfax sipped their five-o&rsquo;clock &ldquo;Manhattan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Henderson likes to do a good-natured thing still, now and then. Do
      you know his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Who was she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, old Eschelle&rsquo;s daughter, Carmen; of course you wouldn&rsquo;t know; that
      was ten years ago. There was a good deal of talk about it at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some said they&rsquo;d been good friends before Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Carmen, as you call her, wasn&rsquo;t the first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but she was an easy second. She&rsquo;s a social climber; bound to get
      there from the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devilish. She&rsquo;s a little thing. I saw her once at Homburg, on the
      promenade with her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kind of sweet blonde, I said to myself, that would mix a man up in a
      duel before he knew where he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was always clever, and she knows enough to play a straight game and
      when to propitiate. I&rsquo;ll bet a five she tells Henderson whom to be good to
      when the chance offers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then her influence on him is good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, she gets what she wants, and Henderson is going to the...
      well, look at the lines in his face. I&rsquo;ve known Henderson since he came
      fresh into the Street. He&rsquo;d rarely knife a friend when his first wife was
      living. Now, when you see the old frank smile on his face, it&rsquo;s put on.&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0065}.jpg" alt="{0065}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0065}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      It was half-past eight when Mr. Henderson with Mrs. Delancy on his arm led
      the way to the diningroom. The procession was closed by Mrs. Henderson and
      Mr. Delancy. The Van Dams were there, and Mrs. Chesney and the Chesney
      girls, and Miss Tavish, who sat on Jack&rsquo;s right, but the rest of the
      guests were unknown to Jack, except by name. There was a strong dash of
      the Street in the mixture, and although the Street was tabooed in the
      talk, there was such an emanation of aggressive prosperity at the table
      that Jack said afterwards that he felt as if he had been at a meeting of
      the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Jack had known the house ten years ago, he would have noticed certain
      subtle changes in it, rather in the atmosphere than in many alterations.
      The newness and the glitter of cost had worn off. It might still be called
      a palace, but the city had now a dozen handsomer houses, and Carmen&rsquo;s
      idea, as she expressed it, was to make this more like a home. She had made
      it like herself. There were pictures on the walls that would not have hung
      there in the late Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s time; and the prevailing air was that
      of refined sensuousness. Life, she said, was her idea, life in its utmost
      expression, untrammeled, and yes, a little Greek. Freedom was perhaps the
      word, and yet her latest notion was simplicity. The dinner was simple. Her
      dress was exceedingly simple, save that it had in it somewhere a touch of
      audacity, revealing in a flash of invitation the hidden nature of the
      woman. She knew herself better than any one knew her, except Henderson,
      and even he was forced to laugh when she travestied Browning in saying
      that she had one soul-side to face the world with, one to show the man she
      loved, and she declared he was downright coarse when on going out of the
      door he muttered, &ldquo;But it needn&rsquo;t be the seamy side.&rdquo; The reported remark
      of some one who had seen her at church that she looked like a nun made her
      smile, but she broke into a silvery laugh when she head Van Dam&rsquo;s comment
      on it, &ldquo;Yes, a devil of a nun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The library was as cozy as ever, but did not appear to be used much as a
      library. Henderson, indeed, had no time to add to his collection or enjoy
      it. Most of the books strewn on the tables were French novels or such
      American tales as had the cachet of social riskiness. But Carmen liked the
      room above all others. She enjoyed her cigarette there, and had a fancy
      for pouring her five-o&rsquo;clock tea in its shelter. Books which had all sorts
      of things in them gave somehow an unconventional atmosphere to the place,
      and one could say things there that one couldn&rsquo;t say in a drawing-room.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0069}.jpg" alt="{0069}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0069}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Henderson himself, it must be confessed, had grown stout in the ten years,
      and puffy under the eyes. There were lines of irritation in his face and
      lines of weariness. He had not kept the freshness of youth so well as
      Carmen, perhaps because of his New England conscience. To his guest he was
      courteous, seemed to be making an effort to be so, and listened with
      well-assumed interest to the story of her day&rsquo;s pilgrimage. At length he
      said, with a smile, &ldquo;Life seems to interest you, Mrs. Delancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Edith, looking up brightly; &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; not life exactly, but things, doing things&mdash;conflict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can understand that. There is so much to be done for everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson looked amused. &ldquo;You know in the city the gospel is that
      everybody is to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Edith, not to be diverted, &ldquo;but, Mr. Henderson, what is it
      all for&mdash;this conflict? Perhaps, however, you are fighting the
      devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it; the devil is usually the other fellow. But, Mrs.
      Delancy,&rdquo; added Henderson, with an accent of seriousness, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      what it&rsquo;s all for. I doubt if there is much in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet the world credits you with finding a great deal in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is generally wrong. Do you understand poker, Mrs. Delancy? No!
      Of course you do not. But the interest of the game isn&rsquo;t so much in the
      cards as in the men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was the stakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. But you want to win for the sake of winning. If I gambled it
      would be a question of nerve. I suppose that which we all enjoy is the
      exercise of skill in winning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And not for the sake of doing anything&mdash;just winning? Don&rsquo;t you get
      tired of that?&rdquo; asked Edith, quite simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in Edith&rsquo;s sincerity, in her fresh enthusiasm about
      life, that appeared to strike a reminiscent note in Henderson. Perhaps he
      remembered another face as sweet as hers, and ideals, faint and long ago,
      that were once mixed with his ideas of success. At any rate, it was with
      an accent of increased deference, and with a look she had not seen in his
      face before, that he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People get tired of everything. I&rsquo;m not sure but it would interest me to
      see for a minute how the world looks through your eyes.&rdquo; And then he
      added, in a different tone, &ldquo;As to your East Side, Mrs. Henderson tried
      that some years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t she interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very much. For a time. But she said there was too much of it.&rdquo; And
      Edith could detect no tone of sarcasm in the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down at the other end of the table, matters were going very smoothly. Jack
      was charmed with his hostess. That clever woman had felt her way along
      from the heresy trial, through Tuxedo and the Independent Theatre and the
      Horse Show, until they were launched in a perfectly free conversation, and
      Carmen knew that she hadn&rsquo;t to look out for thin ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you thinking of going on to the Conventional Club tonight, Mr.
      Delancy?&rdquo; she was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t belong,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Mrs. Delancy said she didn&rsquo;t care for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care for it, for myself,&rdquo; replied Carmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; struck in Miss Tavish. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it does seem to fill a want. Why, what do you do with your evenings,
      Mr. Delancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, but I mean between twelve o&rsquo;clock and bedtime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jack, laughing out loud, &ldquo;I go to bed&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s always that. But you want some place to go to after the
      theatres and the dinners; after the other places are shut up you want to
      go somewhere and be amused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, falling in, &ldquo;it is a fact that there are not many places
      of amusement for the rich; I understand. After the theatres you want to be
      amused. This Conventional Club is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you what it is. It&rsquo;s a sort of Midnight Mission for the rich. They
      never have had anything of the kind in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s very nice,&rdquo; said Miss Tavish, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The performers are selected. You can see things there that you want to
      see at other places to which you can&rsquo;t go. And everybody you know is
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what the Independent Theatre is trying to
      do, and what all the theatrical people say needs to be done, to elevate
      the character of the audiences, and then the managers can give better
      plays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. We want to elevate the stage,&rdquo; Carmen explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;it seems to me that now the audience is select and
      elevated, it wants to see the same sort of things it liked to see before
      it was elevated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may laugh, Mr. Delancy,&rdquo; replied Carmen, throwing an earnest
      simplicity into her eyes, &ldquo;but why shouldn&rsquo;t women know what is going on
      as well as men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why,&rdquo; Miss Tavish asked, &ldquo;will the serpentine dances and the London
      topical songs do any more harm to women than to men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides, Mr. Delancy,&rdquo; Carmen said, chiming in, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it just as
      proper that women should see women dance and throw somersaults on the
      stage as that men should see them? And then, you know, women are such a
      restraining influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I thought the Conventional was for
      the benefit of the audience, not for the salvation of the performers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s both. It&rsquo;s life. Don&rsquo;t you think women ought to know life? How are
      they to take their place in the world unless they know life as men know
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know whose place they are to take, the serpentine
      dancer&rsquo;s or mine,&rdquo; said Jack, as if he were studying a problem. &ldquo;How does
      your experiment get on, Miss Tavish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen looked up quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t any experiment,&rdquo; said Miss Tavish, shaking her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      just Mr. Delancy&rsquo;s nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had an experiment. There is so little for women to do. I wish I
      knew what was right.&rdquo; And Carmen looked mournfully demure, as if life,
      after all, were a serious thing with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever Mrs. Henderson does is sure to be right,&rdquo; said Jack, gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen shot at him a quick sympathetic glance, tempered by a grateful
      smile. &ldquo;There are so many points of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack felt the force of the remark as he did the revealing glance. And he
      had a swift vision of Miss Tavish leading him a serpentine dance, and of
      Carmen sweetly beckoning him to a pleasant point of view. After all it
      doesn&rsquo;t much matter. Everything is in the point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner and cigars and cigarettes in the library, the talk dragged a
      little in duets. The dinner had been charming, the house was lovely, the
      company was most agreeable. All said that. It had been so somewhere else
      the night before that, and would be the next night. And the ennui of it
      all! No one expressed it, but Henderson could not help looking it, and
      Carmen saw it. That charming hostess had been devoting herself to Edith
      since dinner. She was so full of sympathy with the East-Side work, asked a
      hundred questions about it, and declared that she must take it up again.
      She would order a cage of canaries from that poor German for her kitchen.
      It was such a beautiful idea. But Edith did not believe in her one bit.
      She told Jack afterwards that &ldquo;Mrs. Henderson cares no more for the poor
      of New York than she does for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henderson?&rdquo; suggested Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. Henderson has only one idea&mdash;to
      get the better of everybody, and be the money king of New York. But I
      should not wonder if he had once a soft spot in his heart. He is better
      than she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was still early, lacked half an hour of midnight, and the night was
      before them. Some one proposed the Conventional. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carmen; &ldquo;all
      come to our box.&rdquo; The Van Dams would go, Miss Tavish, the Chesneys; the
      suggestion was a relief to everybody. Only Mr. Henderson pleaded important
      papers that must have his attention that night. Edith said that she was
      too tired, but that her desertion must not break up the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will excuse me also,&rdquo; said Jack, a little shade of
      disappointment in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Edith, quickly; &ldquo;you can drop me on the way. Go, by all
      means, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want me to go, dear?&rdquo; said Jack, aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why of course; I want you to be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jack recalled the loving look that accompanied these words, later on,
      as he sat in the Henderson box at the Conventional, between Carmen and
      Miss Tavish, and saw, through the slight haze of smoke, beyond the
      orchestra, the praiseworthy efforts of the Montana Kicker, who had just
      returned with the imprimatur of Paris, to relieve the ennui of the modern
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complex affair we call the world requires a great variety of people to
      keep it going. At one o&rsquo;clock in the morning Carmen and our friend Mr.
      Delancy and Miss Tavish were doing their part. Edith lay awake listening
      for Jack&rsquo;s return. And in an alley off Rivington Street a young girl,
      pretty once, unknown to fortune but not to fame, was about to render the
      last service she could to the world by leaving it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impartial historian scarcely knows how to distribute his pathos. By
      the electric light (and that is the modern light) gayety is almost as
      pathetic as suffering. Before the Montana girl hit upon the happy device
      that gave her notoriety, her feet, whose every twinkle now was worth a
      gold eagle, had trod a thorny path. There was a fortune now in the whirl
      of her illusory robes, but any day&mdash;such are the whims of fashion&mdash;she
      might be wandering again, sick at heart, about the great city, knocking at
      the side doors of variety shows for any engagement that would give her a
      pittance of a few dollars a week. How long had Carmen waited on the social
      outskirts; and now she had come into her kingdom, was she anything but a
      tinsel queen? Even Henderson, the great Henderson, did the friends of his
      youth respect him? had he public esteem? Carmen used to cut out the
      newspaper paragraphs that extolled Henderson&rsquo;s domestic virtue and his
      generosity to his family, and show them to her lord, with a queer smile on
      her face. Miss Tavish, in the nervous consciousness of fleeting years, was
      she not still waiting, dashing here and there like a bird in a net for the
      sort of freedom, audacious as she was, that seemed denied her? She was
      still beautiful, everybody said, and she was sought and flattered, because
      she was always merry and good-natured. Why should Van Dam, speaking of
      women, say that there were horses that had been set up, and checked up and
      trained, that held their heads in an aristocratic fashion, moved
      elegantly, and showed style, long after the spirit had gone out of them?
      And Jack himself, happily married, with a comfortable income, why was life
      getting flat to him? What sort of career was it that needed the aid of
      Carmen and the serpentine dancer? And why not, since it is absolutely
      necessary that the world should be amused?

    <p>
      We are in no other world when we enter the mean tenement in the alley off
      Rivington Street. Here also is the life of the town. The room is small,
      but it contains a cook-stove, a chest of drawers, a small table, a couple
      of chairs, and two narrow beds. On the top of the chest are a
      looking-glass, some toilet articles, and bottles of medicine. The cracked
      walls are bare and not clean. In one of the beds are two children,
      sleeping soundly, and on the foot of it is a middle-aged woman, in a
      soiled woolen gown with a thin figured shawl drawn about her shoulders, a
      dirty cap half concealing her frowzy hair; she looks tired and worn and
      sleepy. On the other bed lies a girl of twenty years, a woman in
      experience. The kerosene lamp on the stand at the head of the bed casts a
      spectral light on her flushed face, and the thin arms that are restlessly
      thrown outside the cover. By the bedside sits the doctor, patient, silent,
      and watchful. The doctor puts her hand caressingly on that of the girl. It
      is hot and dry. The girl opens her eyes with a startled look, and says,
      feebly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he will come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, presently. He never fails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl closed her eyes again, and there was silence. The dim rays of the
      lamp, falling upon the doctor, revealed the figure of a woman of less than
      medium size, perhaps of the age of thirty or more, a plain little body,
      you would have said, who paid the slightest possible attention to her
      dress, and when she went about the city was not to be distinguished from a
      working-woman. Her friends, indeed, said that she had not the least care
      for her personal appearance, and unless she was watched, she was sure to
      go out in her shabbiest gown and most battered hat. She wore tonight a
      brown ulster and a nondescript black bonnet drawn close down on her head
      and tied with black strings. In her lap lay her leathern bag, which she
      usually carried under her arm, that contained medicines, lint, bandages,
      smelling-salts, a vial of ammonia, and so on; to her patients it was a
      sort of conjurer&rsquo;s bag, out of which she could produce anything that an
      emergency called for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Leigh was not in the least nervous or excited. Indeed, an artist would
      not have painted her as a rapt angelic visitant to this abode of poverty.
      This contact with poverty and coming death was quite in her ordinary
      experience. It would never have occurred to her that she was doing
      anything unusual, any more than it would have occurred to the objects of
      her ministrations to overwhelm her with thanks. They trusted her, that was
      all. They met her always with a pleasant recognition. She belonged perhaps
      to their world. Perhaps they would have said that &ldquo;Dr. Leigh don&rsquo;t
      handsome much,&rdquo; but their idea was that her face was good. That was what
      anybody would have said who saw her tonight, &ldquo;She has such a good face;&rdquo;
       the face of a woman who knew the world, and perhaps was not very sanguine
      about it, had few illusions and few antipathies, but accepted it, and
      tried in her humble way to alleviate its hardships, without any
      consciousness of having a mission or making a sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Leigh&mdash;Miss Ruth Leigh&mdash;was Edith&rsquo;s friend. She had not come
      from the country with an exalted notion of being a worker among the poor
      about whom so much was written; she had not even descended from some high
      circle in the city into this world, moved by a restless enthusiasm for
      humanity. She was a woman of the people, to adopt a popular phrase. From
      her childhood she had known them, their wants, their sympathies, their
      discouragements; and in her heart&mdash;though you would not discover this
      till you had known her long and well&mdash;there was a burning sympathy
      with them, a sympathy born in her, and not assumed for the sake of having
      a career. It was this that had impelled her to get a medical education,
      which she obtained by hard labor and self-denial. To her this was not a
      means of livelihood, but simply that she might be of service to those all
      about her who needed help more than she did. She didn&rsquo;t believe in
      charity, this stout-hearted, clearheaded little woman; she meant to make
      everybody pay for her medical services who could pay; but somehow her
      practice was not lucrative, and the little salary she got as a dispensary
      doctor melted away with scarcely any perceptible improvement in her own
      wardrobe. Why, she needed nothing, going about as she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat&mdash;now waiting for the end; and the good face, so full of
      sympathy for the living, had no hope in it. Just another human being had
      come to the end of her path&mdash;the end literally. It was so everyday.
      Somebody came to the end, and there was nothing beyond. Only it was the
      end, and that was peace. One o&rsquo;clock&mdash;half-past one. The door opened
      softly. The old woman rose from the foot of the bed with a start and a low
      &ldquo;Herr! gross Gott.&rdquo; It was Father Damon. The girl opened her eyes with a
      frightened look at first, and then an eager appeal. Dr. Leigh rose to make
      room for him at the bedside. They bowed as he came forward, and their eyes
      met. She shook her head. In her eyes was no expectation, no hope. In his
      was the glow of faith. But the eyes of the girl rested upon his face with
      a rapt expression. It was as if an angel had entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon was a young man, not yet past thirty, slender, erect. He had
      removed as he came in his broad-brimmed soft hat. The hair was close-cut,
      but not tonsured. He wore a brown cassock, falling in straight lines, and
      confined at the waist with a white cord. From his neck depended from a
      gold chain a large gold cross. His face was smooth-shaven, thin,
      intellectual, or rather spiritual; the nose long, the mouth straight, the
      eyes deep gray, sometimes dreamy and puzzling, again glowing with an inner
      fervor. A face of long vigils and the schooled calmness of repressed
      energy. You would say a fanatic of God, with a dash of self-consciousness.
      Dr. Leigh knew him well. They met often on their diverse errands, and she
      liked, when she could, to go to vespers in the little mission chapel of
      St. Anselm, where he ministered. It was not the confessional that
      attracted her, that was sure; perhaps not altogether the service, though
      that was soothing in certain moods; but it was the noble personality of
      Father Damon. He was devoted to the people as she was, he understood them;
      and for the moment their passion of humanity assumed the same aspect,
      though she knew that what he saw, or thought he saw, lay beyond her
      agnostic vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon was an Englishman, a member of a London Anglican order, who
      had taken the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, who had been
      for some years in New York, and had finally come to live on the East Side,
      where his work was. In a way he had identified himself with the people; he
      attended their clubs; he was a Christian socialist; he spoke on the
      inequalities of taxation; the strikers were pretty sure of his sympathy;
      he argued the injustice of the present ownership of land. Some said that
      he had joined a lodge of the Knights of Labor. Perhaps it was these
      things, quite as much as his singleness of purpose and his spiritual
      fervor, that drew Dr. Leigh to him with a feeling that verged on devotion.
      The ladies up-town, at whose tables Father Damon was an infrequent guest,
      were as fully in sympathy with this handsome and aristocratic young
      priest, and thought it beautiful that he should devote himself to the poor
      and the sinful; but they did not see why he should adopt their views.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the mission that Father Damon had first seen the girl. She had
      ventured in not long ago at twilight, with her cough and her pale face, in
      a silk gown and flower-garden of a hat, and crept into one of the
      confessional boxes, and told him her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Father,&rdquo; said the girl, looking up wistfully, &ldquo;that I can&mdash;can
      be forgiven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon looked down sadly, pitifully. &ldquo;Yes, my daughter, if you
      repent. It is all with our Father. He never refuses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down, with his cross in his hand, and in a low voice repeated the
      prayer for the dying. As the sweet, thrilling voice went on in
      supplication the girl&rsquo;s eyes closed again, and a sweet smile played about
      her mouth; it was the innocent smile of the little girl long ago, when she
      might have awakened in the morning and heard the singing of birds at her
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Father Damon arose she seemed to be sleeping. They all stood in
      silence for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will remain?&rdquo; he asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, with the faintest wan smile on her face. &ldquo;It is I, you
      know, who have care of the body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door he turned and said, quite low, &ldquo;Peace be to this house!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Father Damon came dangerously near to being popular. The austerity of his
      life and his known self-chastening vigils contributed to this effect. His
      severely formal, simple ecclesiastical dress, coarse in material but
      perfect in its saintly lines, separated him from the world in which he
      moved so unostentatiously and humbly, and marked him as one who went about
      doing good. His life was that of self-absorption and hardship,
      mortification of the body, denial of the solicitation of the senses,
      struggling of the spirit for more holiness of purpose&mdash;a life of
      supplication for the perishing souls about him. And yet he was so informed
      with the modern spirit that he was not content, as a zealot formerly might
      have been, to snatch souls out of the evil that is in the world, but he
      strove to lessen the evil. He was a reformer. It was probably this feature
      of his activity, and not his spiritual mission, that attracted to him the
      little group of positivists on the East Side, the demagogues of the labor
      lodges, the practical workers of the working-girls&rsquo; clubs, and the
      humanitarian agnostics like Dr. Leigh, who were literally giving their
      lives without the least expectation of reward. Even the refined
      ethical-culture groups had no sneer for Father Damon. The little chapel of
      St. Anselm was well known. It was always open. It was plain, but its
      plainness was not the barrenness of a non-conformist chapel. There were
      two confessionals; a great bronze lamp attached to one of the pillars
      scarcely dispelled the obscurity, but cast an unnatural light upon the
      gigantic crucifix that hung from a beam in front of the chancel. There
      were half a dozen rows of backless benches in the centre of the chapel.
      The bronze lamp, and the candles always burning upon the altar, rather
      accented than dissipated the heavy shadows in the vaulted roof. At no hour
      was it empty, but at morning prayer and at vespers the benches were apt to
      be filled, and groups of penitents or spectators were kneeling or standing
      on the floor. At vespers there were sure to be carriages in front of the
      door, and among the kneeling figures were ladies who brought into these
      simple services for the poor something of the refinement of grace as it is
      in the higher circles. Indeed, at the hour set apart for confession, there
      were in the boxes saints from up-town as well as sinners from the slums.
      Sometimes the sinners were from up-town and the saints from the slums.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the organ sounded, and through a low door in the chancel the priest
      entered, preceded by a couple of acolytes, and advanced swiftly to the
      reading-desk, there was an awed hush in the congregation. One would not
      dare to say that there was a sentimental feeling for the pale face and
      rapt expression of the devotee. It was more than that. He had just come
      from some scene of suffering, from the bed of one dying; he was weary with
      watching. He was faint with lonely vigils; he was visibly carrying the
      load of the poor and the despised. Even Ruth Leigh, who had dropped in for
      half an hour in one of her daily rounds&mdash;even Ruth Leigh, who had in
      her stanch, practical mind a contempt for forms and rituals, and no faith
      in anything that she could not touch, and who at times was indignant at
      the efforts wasted over the future of souls concerning which no one knew
      anything, when there were so many bodies, which had inherited disease and
      poverty and shame, going to worldly wreck before so-called Christian eyes&mdash;even
      she could scarcely keep herself from adoring this self-sacrificing spirit.
      The woes of humanity grieved him as they grieved her, and she used to say
      she did not care what he believed so long as he gave his life for the
      needy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when he advanced to the altar-rail to speak that the man best
      appeared. His voice, which was usually low and full of melody, could be
      something terrible when it rose in denunciation of sin. Those who had
      traveled said that he had the manner of a preaching friar&mdash;the simple
      language, so refined and yet so homely and direct, the real, the inspired
      word, the occasional hastening torrent of words. When he had occasion to
      address one of the societies of ladies for the promotion of something
      among the poor, his style and manner were simplicity itself. One might
      have said there was a shade of contempt in his familiar and not seldom
      slightly humorous remarks upon society and its aims and aspirations, about
      which he spoke plainly and vigorously. And this was what the ladies liked.
      Especially when he referred to the pitifulness of class distinctions, in
      the light of the example of our Lord, in our short pilgrimage in this
      world. This unveiling and denunciation made them somehow feel nearer to
      their work, and, indeed, while they sat there, co-workers with this
      apostle of righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there was something in the priestly dress that affected not only
      the congregation in the chapel, but all the neighborhood in which Father
      Damon lived. There was in the long robe, with its feminine lines, an
      assurance to the women that he was set apart and not as others were; and,
      on the other hand, the semi-feminine suggestion of the straight-falling
      garment may have had for the men a sort of appeal for defense and even
      protection. It is certain, at any rate, that Father Damon had the
      confidence of high and low, rich and poor. The forsaken sought him out,
      the hungry went to him, the dying sent for him, the criminal knocked at
      the door of his little room, even the rich reprobate would have opened his
      bad heart to him sooner than to any one else. It is evident, therefore,
      that Father Damon was dangerously near to being popular. Human vanity will
      feed on anything within its reach, and there has been discovered yet no
      situation that will not minister to its growth. Suffering perhaps it
      prefers, and contumely and persecution. Are not opposition, despiteful
      anger, slander even, rejection of men, stripes even, if such there could
      be in these days, manna to the devout soul consciously set apart for a
      mission? But success, obsequiousness, applause, the love of women, the
      concurrent good opinion of all humanitarians, are these not almost as
      dangerous as persecution? Father Damon, though exalted in his calling, and
      filled with a burning zeal, was a sincere man, and even his eccentricities
      of saintly conduct expressed to his mind only the high purpose of
      self-sacrifice. Yet he saw, he could not but see, the spiritual danger in
      this rising tide of adulation. He fought against its influence, he prayed
      against it, he tried to humiliate himself, and his very humiliations
      increased the adulation. He was perplexed, almost ashamed, and examined
      himself to see how it was that he himself seemed to be thwarting his own
      work. Sometimes he withdrew from it for a week together, and buried
      himself in a retreat in the upper part of the island. Alas! did ever a man
      escape himself in a retreat? It made him calm for the moment. But why was
      it, he asked himself, that he had so many followers, his religion so few?
      Why was it, he said, that all the humanitarians, the reformers, the
      guilds, the ethical groups, the agnostics, the male and female knights,
      sustained him, and only a few of the poor and friendless knocked, by his
      solicitation, at the supernatural door of life? How was it that a woman
      whom he encountered so often, a very angel of mercy, could do the things
      he was doing, tramping about in the misery and squalor of the great city
      day and night, her path unilluminated by a ray from the future life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he had been remiss in his duty. Perhaps he was letting a vague
      philanthropy take the place of a personal solicitude for individual souls.
      The elevation of the race! What had the land question to do with the
      salvation of man? Suppose everybody on the East Side should become as
      industrious, as self-denying, as unselfish as Ruth Leigh, and yet without
      belief, without hope! He had accepted the humanitarian situation with her,
      and never had spoken to her of the eternal life. What unfaithfulness to
      his mission and to her! It should be so no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after one of his weeks of retreat, at the close of vesper service,
      that Dr. Leigh came to him. He had been saying in his little talk that
      poverty is no excuse for irreligion, and that all aid in the hardship of
      this world was vain and worthless unless the sinner laid hold on eternal
      life. Dr. Leigh, who was laboring with a serious practical problem, heard
      this coldly, and with a certain contempt for what seemed to her a vague
      sort of consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, when she came to him in the vestry, with a drop from the
      rather austere manner in which he had spoken, &ldquo;what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me, nothing, Father Damon. I thought perhaps you would go round with
      me to see a pretty bad case. It is in your parish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, did they send for me? Do they want spiritual help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First the natural, then the spiritual,&rdquo; she replied, with a slight tone
      of sarcasm in her voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just like a priest,&rdquo; she was thinking. &ldquo;I
      do not know what to do, and something must be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you report to the Associated Charities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But there&rsquo;s a hitch somewhere. The machine doesn&rsquo;t take hold. The
      man says he doesn&rsquo;t want any charity, any association, treating him like a
      pauper. He&rsquo;s off peddling; but trade is bad, and he&rsquo;s been away a week.
      I&rsquo;m afraid he drinks a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mother is sick in bed. I found her trying to do some fine stitching,
      but she was too weak to hold up the muslin. There are five young children.
      The family never has had help before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon put on his hat, and they went out together, and for some time
      picked their way along the muddy streets in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he asked, in a softened voice, &ldquo;Is the mother a Christian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask,&rdquo; she replied shortly. &ldquo;I found her crying because the
      children were hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon, still under the impression of his neglect of duty, did not
      heed her warning tone, but persisted, &ldquo;You have so many opportunities, Dr.
      Leigh, in your visits of speaking a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo; she asked, refusing to understand, and hardened at the
      slightest sign of what she called cant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the necessity of repentance and preparation for another life,&rdquo; he
      answered, softly but firmly. &ldquo;You surely do not think human beings are
      created just for this miserable little experience here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I have too much to do with the want and suffering I see to
      raise anxieties about a world of which no one can possibly know anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he persisted, &ldquo;have you no sense of incompleteness in this
      life, in your own life? no inward consciousness of an undying
      personality?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was angry for a moment at this intrusion. It had seemed natural
      enough for Father Damon to address his exhortations to the poor and sinful
      of his mission. She admired his spirit, she had a certain sympathy with
      him; for who could say that ministering to minds diseased might not have a
      physical influence to lift these people into a more decent and prosperous
      way of living? She had thought of herself as working with him to a common
      end. But for him now to turn upon her, absolutely ignoring the solid,
      rational, and scientific ground on which he knew, or should know, she
      stood, and to speak to her as one of the &ldquo;lost,&rdquo; startled her, and filled
      her with indignation. She had on her lips a sarcastic reply to the effect
      that even if she had a soul, she had not taken up her work in the city as
      a means of saving it; but she was not given to sarcasm, and before she
      spoke she looked at her companion, and saw in the eyes a look of such
      genuine humble feeling, contradicting the otherwise austere expression of
      his face, that her momentary bitterness passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, Father Damon,&rdquo; she said, gently, &ldquo;we had better not talk of
      that. I don&rsquo;t have much time for theorizing, you know, nor much
      inclination,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest saw that for the present he could make no progress, and after a
      little silence the conversation went back to the family they were about to
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the woman better&mdash;at least, more cheerful. Father Damon
      noticed that there were medicines upon the stand, and that there were the
      remains of a meal which the children had been eating. He turned to the
      doctor. &ldquo;I see that you have been providing for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the eldest boy had already been out and begged a piece of bread when
      I came. Of course they had to have something more at once. But it is very
      little that I can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down by the bed, and talked with the mother, getting her story,
      while the doctor tidied up the room a bit, and then, taking the youngest
      child in her lap and drawing the others about her, began to tell a story
      in a low voice. Presently she was aware that the priest was on his knees
      and saying a prayer. She stopped in her story, and looked out through the
      dirty window into the chill and dark area.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing?&rdquo; whispered one of the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said, and a sort of chill came over her heart. It all
      seemed a mockery, in these surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rose he said to the woman, &ldquo;We will see that you do not want till
      your husband comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will look in tomorrow,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were in the street, Father Damon thanked her for calling his
      attention to the case, thanked her a little formally, and said that he
      would make inquiries and have it properly attended to. And then he asked:
      &ldquo;Is your work ended for the day? You must be tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; I have several visits to make. I&rsquo;m not tired. I rather think it
      is good for me, being out-of-doors so much.&rdquo; She thanked him, and said
      good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood and watched the plain, resolute little woman
      threading her way through the crowded and unclean street, and then slowly
      walked away to his apartment, filled with sadness and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apartment which he occupied was not far from the mission chapel, and
      it was the one clean spot among the ill-kept tenements; but as to comfort,
      it was not much better than the cell of an anchorite. Of this, however, he
      was not thinking as he stretched himself out on his pallet to rest a
      little from the exhausting labors of the day. Probably it did not occur to
      him that his self-imposed privations lessened his strength for his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking of Ruth Leigh. What a rare soul! And yet apparently she
      did not think or care whether she had a soul. What could be the spring of
      her incessant devotion? If ever woman went about doing good in an
      unselfish spirit it was she. Yet she confessed her work hopeless. She had
      no faith, no belief in immortality, no expectation of any reward, nothing
      to offer to anybody beyond this poor life. Was this the enthusiasm of
      humanity, of which he heard so much? But she did not seem to have any
      illusions, or to be burned up by enthusiasm. She just kept on. Ah, he
      thought, what a woman she would be if she were touched by the fire of
      faith!
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, Ruth Leigh went on her round. One day was like another, except
      that every day the kaleidoscope of misery showed new combinations, new
      phases of suffering and incompetence, and there was always a fresh
      interest in that. For years now this had been her life, in the chill of
      winter and the heat of summer, without rest or vacation. The amusements,
      the social duties, the allurements of dress and society, that so much
      occupied the thoughts of other women, did not seem to come into her life.
      For books she had little time, except the books of her specialty. The most
      exciting novels were pale compared with her daily experiences of real
      life. Almost her only recreation was a meeting of the working-girls, a
      session of her labor lodge, or an assembly at the Cooper Union, where some
      fiery orator, perhaps a priest, or a clever agitator, a working-man glib
      of speech, who had a mass of statistics at the end of his tongue, who read
      and discussed, in some private club of zealots of humanity, metaphysics,
      psychology, and was familiar with the whole literature of labor and
      socialism, awoke the enthusiasm of the discontented or the unemployed, and
      where men and women, in clear but homely speech, told their individual
      experiences of wrong and injustice. There was evidence in all these
      demonstrations and organizations that the world was moving, and that the
      old order must change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years and years the little woman had gone on with her work, and she
      frankly confessed to Edith, one day when they were together going her
      rounds, that she could see no result from it all. The problem of poverty
      and helplessness and incapacity seemed to her more hopeless than when she
      began. There might be a little enlightenment here and there, but there was
      certainly not less misery. The state of things was worse than she thought
      at first; but one thing cheered her: the people were better than she
      thought. They might be dull and suspicious in the mass, but she found so
      much patience, unselfishness, so many people of good hearts and warm
      affections.

    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the people,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should choose for friends. They are
      natural, unsophisticated. And do you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that what most
      surprises me is the number of reading, thoughtful people among those who
      do manual labor. I doubt if on your side of town the best books, the real
      fundamental and abstruse books, are so read and discussed, or the
      philosophy of life is so seriously considered, as in certain little
      circles of what you call the working-classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it all very revolutionary?&rdquo; asked Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied the doctor, dryly. &ldquo;But they have no more fads than
      other people. Their theories seem to them not only practical, but they try
      to apply them to actual legislation; at any rate, they discriminate in
      vagaries. You would have been amused the other night in a small circle at
      the lamentations over a member&mdash;he was a car-driver&mdash;who was the
      authoritative expositor of Schopenhauer, because he had gone off into
      Theosophy. It showed such weakness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that the members of that circle were Nihilists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The club has not that name, but probably the members would not care to
      repudiate the title, or deny that they were Nihilists theoretically&mdash;that
      is, if Nihilism means an absolute social and political overturning in
      order that something better may be built up. And, indeed, if you see what
      a hopeless tangle our present situation is, where else can the mind
      logically go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pitiful enough,&rdquo; Edith admitted. &ldquo;But all this movement you speak
      of seems to me a vague agitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; the doctor said, after a moment, &ldquo;that you appreciate the
      intellectual force that is in it all, or allow for the fermenting power in
      the great discontented mass of these radical theories on the problem of
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a specimen of the sort of talk that Edith and the doctor often
      drifted into in their mission work. As Ruth Leigh tramped along late this
      afternoon in the slush of the streets, from one house of sickness and
      poverty to another, a sense of her puny efforts in this great mass of
      suffering and injustice came over her anew. Her indignation rose against
      the state of things. And Father Damon, who was trying to save souls, was
      he accomplishing anything more than she? Why had he been so curt with her
      when she went to him for help this afternoon? Was he just a narrow-minded,
      bigoted priest? A few nights before she had heard him speak on the single
      tax at a labor meeting. She recalled his eloquence, his profound sympathy
      with the cause of the people, the thrilling, pathetic voice, the
      illumination of his countenance, the authority, the consecration in his
      attitude and dress; and he was transfigured to her then, as he was now in
      her thought, into an apostle of humanity. Alas! she thought, what a leader
      he would be if he would break loose from his superstitious traditions!

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The acquaintance between the house of Henderson and the house of Delancy
      was not permitted to languish. Jack had his reasons for it, which may have
      been financial, and Carmen had her reasons, which were probably purely
      social. What was the good of money if it did not bring social position?
      and what, on the other hand, was the good of social position if you could
      not use it to get money?
    </p>
    <p>
      In his recent association with the newly rich, Jack&rsquo;s twenty thousand a
      year began to seem small. In fact, in the lowering of the rate of interest
      and the shrinkage of securities, it was no longer twenty thousand a year.
      This would have been a matter of little consequence in the old order. His
      lot was not cast among the poor; most of his relations had solid fortunes,
      and many of them were millionaires, or what was equivalent to that, before
      the term was invented. But they made little display; none at all merely
      for the purpose of exhibition, or to gain or keep social place. In this
      atmosphere in which he was born Jack floated along without effort, with no
      demand upon him to keep up with a rising standard of living. Even
      impecuniosity, though inconvenient, would not have made him lose caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was changing now. Since the introduction of a new element even
      the conservative old millions had begun to feel the stir of uneasiness,
      and to launch out into extravagance in rivalry with the new millions. Even
      with his relations Jack began to feel that he was poor. It did not spur
      him to do anything, to follow the example, for instance, of the young
      fellows from the country, who were throwing themselves into Wall Street
      with the single purpose of becoming suddenly rich, but it made him uneasy.
      And when he was with the Hendersons, or Miss Tavish, whose father, though
      not newly rich, was one of the most aggressive of speculators, and saw how
      easily every luxurious desire glided into fulfillment, he felt for the
      first time in his life the emotion of envy. It seemed then that only
      unlimited money could make the world attractive. Why, even to keep up with
      the unthinking whims of Miss Tavish would bankrupt him in six months. That
      little spread at Wherry&rsquo;s for the theatre party the other night, though he
      made light of it to Edith, was almost the price he couldn&rsquo;t afford to pay
      for Storm. He had a grim thought that midwinter flowers made dining as
      expensive as dying. Carmen, whom nothing escaped, complimented him on his
      taste, quite aware that he couldn&rsquo;t afford it, and, apropos, told him of a
      lady in Chicago who, hearing that the fashion had changed, wrote on her
      dinner cards, &ldquo;No flowers.&rdquo; It was only a matter of course for these
      people to build a new country-house in any spot that fashion for the
      moment indicated, to equip their yachts for a Mediterranean voyage or for
      loitering down the Southern coast, to give a ball that was the talk of the
      town, to make up a special train of luxurious private cars for Mexico or
      California. Even at the clubs the talk was about these things and the
      opportunities for getting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rumor about town that Henderson was a good deal extended. It
      alarmed a hundred people, not on Henderson&rsquo;s account, but their own. When
      one of them consulted Uncle Jerry, that veteran smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess Henderson&rsquo;s all right. But I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it meant a
      squeeze. Of course if he&rsquo;s extended, it&rsquo;s an excuse for settling up, and
      the shorts will squeal. I&rsquo;ve seen Henderson extended a good many times,&rdquo;
       and the old man laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This opinion, when reported, did not seem to quiet Jack&rsquo;s fears, who saw
      his own little venture at the mercy of a sweeping Street game. It occurred
      to him that he possibly might get a little light on the matter by dropping
      in that afternoon and taking a quiet cup of tea with Mrs. Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her in the library. Outdoors winter was slouching into spring
      with a cold drizzle, with a coating of ice on the pavements-animating
      weather for the medical profession. Within, there was the glow of warmth
      and color that Carmen liked to create for herself. In an entrancing
      tea-gown, she sat by a hickory fire, with a fresh magazine in one hand and
      a big paper-cutter in the other. She rose at Jack&rsquo;s entrance, and,
      extending her hand, greeted him with a most cordial smile. It was so good
      of him! She was so lonesome! He could himself see that the lonesomeness
      was dissipated, as she seated him in a comfortable chair by the fire, and
      then stood a moment looking at him, as if studying his comfort. She was
      such a domestic woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look tired, monsieur,&rdquo; she said, as she passed behind his chair and
      rested the tip of her forefinger for a second on his head. &ldquo;I shall make
      you a cup of tea at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0109}.jpg" alt="{0109}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0109}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Not tired, but bothered,&rdquo; said Jack, stretching out his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a bothering world.&rdquo; She was still behind him,
      and spoke low, but with sympathy. &ldquo;I remember, it&rsquo;s only one lump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could feel her presence, so womanly and friendly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what
      people say,&rdquo; he was thinking, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a good-hearted little thing, and
      understands men.&rdquo; He felt that he could tell her anything, almost anything
      that he could tell a man. She was sympathetic and not squeamish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said, handing him the tea and looking down on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cup was dainty, the fragrance of the tea delicious, the woman
      exquisite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m better already,&rdquo; said Jack, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a cup for herself, handed him the cigarettes, lit one for
      herself, and sat on a low stool not far from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing&mdash;a little business worry. Have you heard any Street
      rumor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rumor?&rdquo; she repeated, with a little start. And then, leaning forward, &ldquo;Do
      you mean that about Mr. Henderson in the morning papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen, relieved, gave a liquid little laugh, and then said, with a change
      to earnestness: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to trust you, my friend. Henderson put it in
      himself! He told me so this morning when I asked him about it. This is
      just between ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack said, &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; but he did not look relieved. The clever creature
      divined the situation without another word, for there was no turn in the
      Street that she was not familiar with. But there was no apparent
      recognition of it, except in her sympathetic tone, when she said: &ldquo;Well,
      the world is full of annoyances. I&rsquo;m bothered myself&mdash;and such a
      little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nothing, not even a rumor. You cannot do anything about it. I don&rsquo;t
      know why I should tell you. But I will.&rdquo; And she paused a moment, looking
      down in an innocent perplexity. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this: I am on the Foundlings&rsquo;
      Board with Mrs. Schuyler Blunt, and I don&rsquo;t know her, and you can&rsquo;t think
      how awkward it is having to meet her every week in that stiff kind of
      way.&rdquo; She did not go on to confide to Jack how she had intrigued to get on
      the board, and how Mrs. Schuyler Blunt, in the most well-bred manner, had
      practically ignored her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s an old friend of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! She&rsquo;s a charming woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We were great cronies when she was Sadie Mack. She isn&rsquo;t a genius,
      but she is good-hearted. I suppose she is on all the charity boards in the
      city. She patronizes everything,&rdquo; Jack continued, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she is,&rdquo; said Carmen, thinking that however good-hearted she
      might be she was very &ldquo;snubby.&rdquo; &ldquo;And it makes it all the more awkward, for
      I am interested in so many things myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can arrange all that,&rdquo; Jack said, in an off-hand way. Carmen&rsquo;s look of
      gratitude could hardly be distinguished from affection. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy
      enough. We are just as good friends as ever, though I fancy she doesn&rsquo;t
      altogether approve of me lately. It&rsquo;s rather nice for a fellow, Mrs.
      Henderson, to have a lot of women keeping him straight, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked
      Jack, in the tone of a bad boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Between us all we will make a model of you. I am so glad now that I
      told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack protested that it was nothing. Why shouldn&rsquo;t friends help each other?
      Why not, indeed, said Carmen, and the talk went on a good deal about
      friendship, and the possibility of it between a man and a woman. This sort
      of talk is considered serious and even deep, not to say philosophic.
      Carmen was a great philosopher in it. She didn&rsquo;t know, but she believed,
      it seemed natural, that every woman should have one man friend. Jack rose
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon?&rdquo; And it did seem pathetically soon. She gave him her hand, and
      then by an impulse she put her left hand over his, and looked up to him in
      quite a business way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Delancy, don&rsquo;t you be troubled about that rumor we were speaking of.
      It will be all right. Trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He understood perfectly, and expressed both his understanding and his
      gratitude by bending over and kissing the little hand that lay in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Carmen sat a long time by the fire reflecting. It would
      be sweet to humiliate the Delancy and Schuyler Blunt set, as Henderson
      could. But what would she gain by that? It would be sweeter still to put
      them under obligations, and profit by that. She had endured a good many
      social rebuffs in her day, this tolerant little woman, and the sting of
      their memory could only be removed when the people who had ignored her had
      to seek social favors she could give. If Henderson only cared as much for
      such things as she did! But he was at times actually brutal about it. He
      seemed to have only one passion. She herself liked money, but only for
      what it would bring. Henderson was like an old Pharaoh, who was bound to
      build the biggest pyramid ever built to his memory; he hated to waste a
      block. But what was the good of that when one had passed beyond the reach
      of envy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Revolving these deep things in her mind, she went to her dressing-room and
      made an elaborate toilet for dinner. Yet it was elaborately simple. That
      sort needed more study than the other. She would like to be the Carmen of
      ten years ago in Henderson&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lord came home late, and did not dress for dinner. It was often so,
      and the omission was usually not allowed to pass by Carmen without notice,
      to which Henderson was sure to growl that he didn&rsquo;t care to be always on
      dress parade. Tonight Carmen was all graciousness and warmth. Henderson
      did not seem to notice it. He ate his dinner abstractedly, and responded
      only in monosyllables to her sweet attempts at conversation. The fact was
      that the day had been a perplexing one; he was engaged in one of his big
      fights, a scheme that aroused all his pugnacity and taxed all his
      resources. He would win&mdash;of course; he would smash everybody, but he
      would win. When he was in this mood Carmen felt that she was like a daisy
      in the path of a cyclone. In the first year of their marriage he used to
      consult her about all his schemes, and value her keen understanding. She
      wondered why he did not now. Did he distrust even her, as he did everybody
      else? Tonight she asked no questions. She was unruffled by his short
      responses to her conversational attempts; by her subtle, wifely manner she
      simply put herself on his side, whatever the side was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the library she brought him his cigar, and lighted it. She saw that his
      coffee was just as he liked it. As she moved about, making things
      homelike, Henderson noticed that she was more Carmenish than he had seen
      her in a long time. The sweet ways and the simple toilet must be by
      intention. And he knew her so well. He began to be amused and softened. At
      length he said, in his ordinary tone, &ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is what, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen looked perplexed and sweetly surprised. There is nothing so pitiful
      about habitual hypocrisy as that it never deceives anybody. It was not the
      less painful now that Carmen knew that Henderson knew her to the least
      fibre of her self-seeking soul, and that she felt that there were currents
      in his life that she could not calculate. A man is so much more difficult
      to understand than a woman, she reflected. And yet he is so susceptible
      that he can be managed even when he knows he is being managed. Carmen was
      not disconcerted for a moment. She replied, with her old candor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an idea! You give me everything I want before I know what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And before I know it either,&rdquo; he responded, with a grim smile. &ldquo;Well,
      what is the news today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same old round. The Foundlings&rsquo; Board, for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you interested in foundlings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; said Carmen, frankly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in those that find them.
      I told you how hateful that Mrs. Schuyler Blunt is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you cut her? Why don&rsquo;t you make it uncomfortable for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find out,&rdquo; she said, with a laugh, dropping into the language of
      the Street, &ldquo;anything she is short in, or I would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want me to get a twist on old Blunt?&rdquo; and Henderson roared with
      laughter at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. Dear, you are just a goose, socially. It is nothing to you,
      but you don&rsquo;t understand what we women have to go through. You don&rsquo;t know
      how hard it is&mdash;that woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has she done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. That&rsquo;s just it. What do you say in the Street&mdash;freeze?
      Well, she is trying to freeze me out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson laughed again. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll back you against the field.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be backed,&rdquo; said Carmen; &ldquo;I want some sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is your idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to tell you. Mr. Delancy dropped in this afternoon for a cup
      of tea&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he knows Mrs. Schuyler Blunt well; they are old friends, and he
      is going to arrange it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrange what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, smooth everything out, don&rsquo;t you know. But, Rodney, I do want you to
      do something for me; not for me exactly, but about this. Won&rsquo;t you look
      out for Mr. Delancy in this deal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me you are a good deal interested in Jack Delancy,&rdquo; said
      Henderson, in a sneering tone. The remark was a mistake, for it gave
      Carmen the advantage, and he did not believe it was just. He knew that
      Carmen was as passionless as a diamond, whatever even she might pretend
      for a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed!&rdquo; she cried, with indignation, and her eyes flared for
      an instant and then filled with tears. &ldquo;And I try so hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t look out for all the lame ducks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a duck,&rdquo; said Carmen, using her handkerchief; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate him for
      a duck. It&rsquo;s just to help me, when you know, when you know&mdash;and it is
      so hard,&rdquo; and the tears came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Henderson believe? After all, what did it matter? Perhaps, after all,
      the woman had a right to her game, as he had to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take on about it. I&rsquo;ll fix it. I&rsquo;ll make a
      memorandum this minute. Only don&rsquo;t you bother me in the future with too
      many private kites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen dried her eyes. She did not look triumphant; she just looked sweet
      and grateful, like a person who had been helped. She went over and kissed
      her lord on the forehead, and sat on the arm of his chair, not too long,
      and then patted him on the shoulder, and said he was a good fellow, and
      she was a little bother, and so went away like a dutiful little wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Henderson sat looking into the fire and musing, with the feeling that
      he had been at the theatre, and that the comedy had been beautifully
      played.
    </p>
    <p>
      His part of the play was carried out next day in good faith. One of the
      secrets of Henderson&rsquo;s success was that he always did what he said he
      would do. This attracted men to him personally, and besides he found, as
      Bismarck did, that it was more serviceable to him than lying, for the
      crafty world usually banks upon insincerity and indirectness. But while he
      kept his word he also kept his schemes to himself, and executed them with
      a single regard to his own interest and a Napoleonic selfishness. He did
      not lie to enemy or friend, but he did not spare either when either was in
      his way. He knew how to appeal to the self-interest of his fellows, and in
      time those who had most to do with him trusted him least when he seemed
      most generous in his offers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, the next day, his secretary reported to him briefly that Delancy was
      greatly elated with the turn things had taken for him, and was going in
      again, Henderson smiled sardonically, and said, &ldquo;It was the worst thing I
      could have done for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack, who did not understand the irony of his temporary rescue, and had
      little experience of commercial integrity, so called, was intent on
      fulfilling his part of the understanding with Carmen. This could best be
      effected by a return dinner to the Hendersons. The subject was broached at
      breakfast in an off-hand manner to Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an agreeable subject to Edith, that was evident; but it was not
      easy for her to raise objections to the dinner. She had gone to the
      Hendersons&rsquo; to please Jack, in her policy of yielding in order to
      influence him; but having accepted the hospitality, she could not object
      to returning it. The trouble was in making the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;who are the Hendersons&rsquo; friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Ask our friends. If we are going to do a thing
      to please them, no use in doing it half-way, so as to offend them, by
      drawing social lines against them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mavick; he&rsquo;ll be over from Washington next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good; and, oh, I&rsquo;ll ask Father Damon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;ll give a kind of flavor to it. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he would
      like to meet such a man as Henderson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then the Van Dams and Miss Tavish; they were at Henderson&rsquo;s, and
      would help to make it easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; well, let&rsquo;s see. The Schuyler Blunts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they wouldn&rsquo;t do at all. They wouldn&rsquo;t come. She wouldn&rsquo;t think of
      going to the Hendersons&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she would come to us. I don&rsquo;t think she would mind once in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you want them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want them particularly; but it would no doubt please the
      Hendersons more than any other thing we could do-and, well, I don&rsquo;t want
      to offend Henderson just now. It&rsquo;s a little thing, anyway. What&rsquo;s the use
      of all this social nonsense? We are not responsible for either the
      Hendersons or the Blunts being in the world. No harm done if they don&rsquo;t
      come. You invite them, and I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was settled, against Edith&rsquo;s instinct of propriety, and the dinner
      was made up by the addition of the elder Miss Chesney. And Jack did
      persuade Mrs. Blunt to accept. In fact, she had a little curiosity to see
      the man whose name was in the newspapers more prominently than that of the
      President.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright thought to secure Mr. Mavick. Mr. Thomas Mavick was
      socially one of the most desirable young men of the day. Matrimonially he
      was not a prize, for he was without fortune and without powerful
      connections. He had a position in the State Department. Originally he came
      from somewhere in the West, it was said, but he had early obtained one or
      two minor diplomatic places; he had lived a good deal abroad; he had
      traveled a little&mdash;a good deal, it would seem, from his occasional
      Oriental allusions. He threw over his past a slight mystery, not too much;
      and he always took himself seriously. His salary was sufficient to set up
      a bachelor very comfortably who always dined out; he dressed in the
      severity of the fashion; he belonged only to the best clubs, where he
      unbent more than anywhere else; he was credited with knowing a good deal
      more than he would tell. It was believed, in fact, that he had a great
      deal of influence. The President had been known to send for him on
      delicate personal business with regard to appointments, and there were
      certain ticklish diplomatic transactions that he was known to have managed
      most cleverly. His friends could see his hand in state papers. This he
      disclaimed, but he never denied that he knew the inside of whatever was
      going on in Washington. Even those who thought him a snob said he was
      clever. He had perfectly the diplomatic manner, and the reserve of one
      charged with grave secrets. Whatever he disclosed was always in
      confidence, so that he had the reputation of being as discreet as he was
      knowing. With women he was of course a favorite, for he knew how to be
      confidential without disclosing anything, and the hints he dropped about
      persons in power simply showed that he was secretly manoeuvring important
      affairs, and could make the most interesting revelations if he chose. His
      smile and the shake of his head at the club when talk was personal
      conveyed a world of meaning. Tom Mavick was, in short, a most accomplished
      fellow. It was evident that he carried on the State Department, and the
      wonder to many was that he was not in a position to do it openly. His
      social prestige was as mysterious as his diplomatic, but it was now
      unquestioned, and he might be considered as one of the first of a class
      who are to reconcile social and political life in this country.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Looking back upon this dinner of the Delancys, the student of human
      affairs can see how Providence uses small means for the accomplishment of
      its purposes. Of all our social contrivances, the formal dinner is
      probably the cause of more anxiety in the arrangement, of more weariness
      in the performance, and usually of less satisfaction in the retrospect
      than any other social function. However carefully the guests are selected,
      it lacks the spontaneity that gives intellectual zest to the chance dining
      together of friends. This Delancy party was made up for reasons which are
      well understood, and it seemed to have been admirably well selected; and
      yet the moment it assembled it was evident that it could not be very
      brilliant or very enjoyable. Doubtless you, madam, would have arranged it
      differently, and not made it up of such incongruous elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, scarcely one of those present would not have had more
      enjoyment somewhere else. Father Damon, whose theory was that the rich
      needed saving quite as much as the poor, would nevertheless have been in
      better spirits sitting down to a collation with the working-women in
      Clinton Place. It was a good occasion for the cynical observation of Mr.
      Mavick, but it was not a company that he could take in hand and impress
      with his mysterious influence in public affairs. Henderson was not in the
      mood, and would have had much more ease over a chop and a bottle of
      half-and-half with Uncle Jerry. Carmen, socially triumphant, would have
      been much more in her element at a petit souper of a not too fastidious
      four. Mrs. Schuyler Blunt was in the unaccustomed position of having to
      maintain a not too familiar and not too distant line of deportment. Edith
      and Jack felt the responsibility of having put an incongruous company on
      thin conventional ice. It was only the easy-going Miss Tavish and two or
      three others who carried along their own animal spirits and love of
      amusement who enjoyed the chance of a possible contretemps.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the dinner was providentially arranged. If these people had not
      met socially, this history would have been different from what it must be.
      The lives of several of them were appreciably modified by this meeting. It
      is too much to say that Father Damon&rsquo;s notion of the means by which such
      men as Henderson succeed was changed, but personal contact with the man
      may have modified his utterances about him, and he may have turned his
      mind to the uses to which his wealth might be applied rather than to the
      means by which he obtained it. Carmen&rsquo;s ingenuous interest in his work may
      have encouraged the hope that at least a portion of this fortune might be
      rescued to charitable uses. For Carmen, dining with Mrs. Schuyler Blunt
      was a distinct gain, and indirectly opened many other hitherto exclusive
      doors. That lady may not have changed her opinion about Carmen, but she
      was good-natured and infected by the incoming social tolerance; and as to
      Henderson, she declared that he was an exceedingly well-bred man, and she
      did not believe half the stories about him. Henderson himself at once
      appreciated the talents of Mavick, gauged him perfectly, and saw what
      services he might be capable of rendering at Washington. Mr. Mavick
      appreciated the advantage of a connection with such a capitalist, and of
      having open to him another luxurious house in New York. At the
      dinner-table Carmen and Mr. Mavick had not exchanged a dozen remarks
      before these clever people felt that they were congenial spirits. It was
      in the smoking-room that Henderson and Mavick fell into an interesting
      conversation, which resulted in an invitation for Mavick to drop in at
      Henderson&rsquo;s office in the morning. The dinner had not been a brilliant
      one. Henderson found it not easy to select topics equally interesting to
      Mrs. Delancy and Mrs. Blunt, and finally fell into geographical
      information to the latter about Mexico and Honduras. For Edith, the sole
      relief of the evening was an exchange of sympathy with Father Damon, and
      she was too much preoccupied to enjoy that. As for Carmen, placed between
      Jack and Mr. Mavick, and conscious that the eyes of Mrs. Blunt were on
      her, she was taking a subdued role, which Jack found much less attractive
      than her common mood. But this was not her only self-sacrifice of the
      evening. She went without her usual cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Edith the dinner was a revelation of new difficulties in the life she
      proposed for herself, though they were rather felt than distinctly
      reasoned about. The social atmosphere was distasteful; its elements were
      out of harmony with her ideals. Not that this society was new to her, but
      that she saw it in a new light. Before her marriage all these things had
      been indifferent to this high-spirited girl. They were merely incidents of
      the social state into which she was born, and she pursued her way among
      them, having a tolerably clear conception of what her own life should be,
      with little recognition of their tendencies. Were only her own life
      concerned, they would still be indifferent to her. But something had
      happened. That which is counted the best thing in life had come to her,
      that best thing which is the touchstone of character as it is of all
      conditions, and which so often introduces inextricable complications. She
      had fallen in love with Jack Delancy and married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first effect of this was to awake and enlarge what philosophers would
      call her enthusiasm of humanity. The second effect was to show her&mdash;and
      this was what this little dinner emphasized&mdash;that she had put
      limitations upon herself and taken on unthought-of responsibilities. To
      put this sort of life one side, or make it secondary to her own idea of a
      useful and happy life, would have been easy but for one thing&mdash;she
      loved Jack. This philosophic reasoning about it does her injustice. It did
      not occur to her that she could go her way and let him go his way. Nor
      must it be supposed that the problem seemed as grave to her as it really
      was&mdash;the danger of frittering away her own higher nature in
      faithfulness to one of the noblest impulses of that nature. Yet this is
      the way that so many trials of life come, and it is the greatest test of
      character. She felt&mdash;as many women do feel&mdash;that if she retained
      her husband&rsquo;s love all would be well, and the danger involved to herself
      probably did not cross her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did cross her mind was that these associations meant only evil
      for Jack, and that to be absorbed in the sort of life that seemed to
      please him was for her to drift away from all her ideals.
    </p>
    <p>
      A confused notion of all this was in her thoughts when she talked with
      Father Damon, while the gentlemen were in the smoking-room. She asked him
      about his mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The interest continues,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but your East Side, Mrs. Delancy,
      is a puzzling place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll laugh if I say there is too much intelligence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith did laugh, and then said: &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better move your mission over
      to this side. Here is a field of good, unadulterated worldliness. But
      what, exactly, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the attempt of science to solve the problem of sin and
      wretchedness. What can you expect when the people are socialists and their
      leaders agnostics?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you were something of a socialist yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; he said, frankly, &ldquo;when I see the present injustice, the
      iniquitous laws and combinations that leave these people so little chance.
      They are ignorant, and expect the impossible; but they are right in many
      things, and I go with them. But my motive is not theirs. I hope not. There
      is no hope except in a spiritual life. Materialism down at the bottom of
      society is no better than materialism at the top. Do you know,&rdquo; he went
      on, with increased warmth, &ldquo;that pessimism is rather the rule over that
      side, and that many of those who labor most among the poor have the least
      hope of ever making things substantially better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But such unselfish people as Dr. Leigh do a great deal of good,&rdquo; Edith
      suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said reflecting&mdash;&ldquo;yes, I have no doubt. I don&rsquo;t understand
      it. She is not hopeful. She sees nothing beyond. I don&rsquo;t know what keeps
      her up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love of humanity, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the phrase had never been invented. Religion of humanity! The work
      is to save the souls of those people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Edith, with a flush of earnestness &ldquo;but, Father Damon, isn&rsquo;t
      human love the greatest power to save?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest looked at the girl. His face softened, and he said, more
      gently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Of the soul, yes. But human love is so apt to stand
      in the way of the higher life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In her soul Edith resented this as an ascetic and priestly view; but she
      knew his devotion to that humanity which he in vain tried to eliminate
      from his austere life, and she turned the talk lightly by saying, &ldquo;Ah,
      that is your theory. But I am coming over soon, and shall expect you and
      Dr. Leigh to take me about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Mr. Mavick&rsquo;s card gave him instant admission to the inner
      office of Mr. Henderson, the approach to whom was more carefully guarded
      than that to the President of the United States. This was not merely
      necessary to save him from the importunities of cranks who might carry
      concealed dynamite arguments, but as well to protect him from hundreds of
      business men with whom he was indirectly dealing, and with whom he wished
      to evade explanations. He thoroughly understood the advantages of delay.
      He also understood the value of the mystery that attends inaccessibility.
      Even Mr. Mavick himself was impressed by the show of ceremony, by the army
      of clerks, and by the signs of complete organization. He knew that the
      visitor was specially favored who penetrated these precincts so far as to
      get an interview, usually fruitless, with Henderson&rsquo;s confidential man.
      This confidential man was a very grave and confidence-begetting person,
      who dealt out dubious hints and promises, and did not at all mind when
      Henderson found it necessary to repudiate as unauthorized anything that
      had been apparently said in his name. To be sure, this gave a general
      impression that Henderson was an inscrutable man to deal with, but at the
      same time it was confessed that his spoken word could be depended on.
      Anything written might, it is true, lead to litigation, and this gave rise
      to a saying in the Street that Henderson&rsquo;s word was better than his bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was not a politician, but he was a friend of politicians. It was
      said that he contributed about equally to both sides in a political
      campaign, and that this showed patriotism more than partisanship. It was
      for his interest to have friends on both sides in Congress, and friends in
      the Cabinet, and it was even hinted that he was concerned to have men
      whose economic and financial theories accorded with his own on the Supreme
      Bench. He had unlimited confidence in the power of money. His visitor of
      the morning was not unlike him in many respects. He also was not a
      politician. He would have described himself as a governmental man, and had
      a theory of running the government with as little popular interference as
      possible. He regarded himself as belonging to the governing class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between these two men, who each had his own interests in view, there was
      naturally an apparent putting aside of reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Mavick,&rdquo; said Henderson,
      cordially. &ldquo;I have known of you for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? I&rsquo;ve been in the employ of the government for some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose it pays pretty well,&rdquo; said Henderson, smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, extravagantly,&rdquo; Mavick rejoined, in the same spirit. &ldquo;You just about
      get your board and clothes out of government. Your washing is another
      thing. You are expected, you know, to have your washing done where you
      vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a sure thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, till you are turned out. You know the theory at Washington is that
      virtue is its own reward. Tom Fakeltree says it&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how he knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Observation, probably. Tom startled a dinner table the other day with the
      remark that when a man once gives himself up to the full enjoyment of a
      virtuous life, it seems strange to him that more people do not follow his
      example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with the virtue of Washington is that it always wants to
      interfere with other people&rsquo;s business. Fellows like Tom are always
      hunting up mares&rsquo; nests in order to be paid for breaking them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say about Tom,&rdquo; rejoined Mavick. &ldquo;I suppose it is necessary to
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. And that goes along with another proposition&mdash;that the
      successful have no rights which the unsuccessful are bound to respect. As
      soon as a man gets ahead,&rdquo; Henderson continued, with a tone of bitterness,
      &ldquo;the whole pack are trying to pull him down. A capitalist is a public
      enemy. Why, look at that Hodge bill! Strikes directly at the ability of
      the railways to develop the country. Have you seen it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mavick admitted; &ldquo;the drawer of it was good enough to consult me on
      its constitutionality. It&rsquo;s a mighty queer bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t get through the Senate,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a bother.
      Such schemes are coming up all the time, and they unsettle business. These
      fellows need watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And managing,&rdquo; added Mavick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I can&rsquo;t be in Washington all the time. And I need to know what
      is going on every twenty-four hours from the inside. I can&rsquo;t rely on
      politicians or lobbyists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Mavick, in his easiest manner, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy enough. You
      want a disinterested friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson nodded, but did not even smile, and the talk went on about other
      measures, and confidentially about certain men in Washington, until, after
      twenty minutes&rsquo; conversation, the two men came to a perfect understanding.
      When Mavick arose to go they shook hands even more cordially than at
      first, and Henderson said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expect to hear from you, and remember that our house will always
      be your home in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It seemed very fortunate to Jack Delancy that he should have such a clever
      woman as Carmen for his confidante, a man so powerful as Henderson as his
      backer, and a person so omniscient as Mavick for his friend. No
      combination could be more desirable for a young man who proposed to
      himself a career of getting money by adroit management and spending it in
      pure and simple self-indulgence. There are plenty of men who have taken
      advantage of like conditions to climb from one position to another, and
      have then kicked down the ladders behind them as fast as they attained a
      new footing. It was Jack&rsquo;s fault that he was not one of these. You could
      scarcely dignify his character by saying that he had an aim, except to
      saunter through life with as little personal inconvenience as possible.
      His selfishness was boneless. It was not by any means negative, for no
      part of his amiable nature was better developed than regard for his own
      care and comfort; but it was not strong enough to give him Henderson&rsquo;s
      capacity for hard work and even self-denial, nor Mavick&rsquo;s cool,
      persevering skill in making a way for himself in the world. Why was not
      Edith his confidante? His respect for her was undoubted; his love for her
      was unquestioned; his trust in her was absolute. And yet with either
      Carmen or Miss Tavish he fell into confidential revelations of himself
      which instinctively he did not make to Edith. The explanation of this is
      on the surface, and it is the key to half the unhappiness in domestic
      life. He felt that Edith was not in sympathy with the associations and the
      life he was leading. The pitiful and hopeless part of it is that if she
      had been in sympathy with them, Jack would have gone on in his frivolous
      career at an accelerated pace. It was not absence of love, it was not
      unfaithfulness, that made Jack enjoy the hours he spent with Carmen, or
      with the pleasing and not too fastidious Miss Tavish, with a zest that was
      wanting to his hours at home. If he had been upon a sinking steamboat with
      the three women, and could have saved only one of them, he would not have
      had a moment&rsquo;s hesitation in rescuing Edith and letting the other two sink
      out of his life. The character is not unusual, nor the situation uncommon.
      What is a woman to do? Her very virtues are enemies of her peace; if she
      appears as a constant check and monitor, she repels; if she weakly
      acquiesces, the stream will flow over both of them. The dilemma seems
      hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a mistake to suppose that either Edith or Jack put their
      relations in any such definite shape as this. He was unthinking. She was
      too high-spirited, too confident of her position, to be assailed by such
      fears. And it must be said, since she was a woman, that she had the
      consciousness of power which goes along with the possession of loveliness
      and keen wit. Those who knew her best knew that under her serenity was a
      gay temperament, inherited from the original settlers of Manhattan, an
      abounding enjoyment of life, and capacity for passion. It was early
      discovered in her childhood that little Edith had a will of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lent was over. It was the time of the twittering of sparrows, of the
      opening of windows, of putting in order the little sentimental spots
      called &ldquo;squares,&rdquo; where the poor children get their idea of forests, and
      the rich renew their faint recollections of innocence and country life;
      when the hawkers go about the streets, and the hand-organs celebrate the
      return of spring and the possibility of love. Even the idle felt that it
      was a time for relaxation and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you answered Miss Tavish&rsquo;s invitation?&rdquo; asked Jack one morning at
      the breakfast-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. I shall decline today for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? It&rsquo;s for charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my charity extends to Miss Tavish. I don&rsquo;t want to see her dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That leaves me in a nice hole. I said I&rsquo;d go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not? You go to a good many places you don&rsquo;t take me&mdash;the
      clubs, brokers&rsquo; offices, Stalker&rsquo;s, the Conventional, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go on. Why do you object to my going to see this dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Jack,&rdquo; said Edith, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t objected the least in the world;&rdquo;
       and her animated face sparkled with a smile, which seemed to irritate Jack
      more than a frown would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you set yourself up. I&rsquo;ll bet Miss Tavish will raise more
      money for the Baxter Street Guild, yes, and do more good, than you and the
      priest and that woman doctor slopping about on the East Side in six
      months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied Edith, still with the same good-humored smile.
      &ldquo;But, Jack, it&rsquo;s delightful to see your philanthropic spirit stirred up in
      this way. You ought to be encouraged. Why don&rsquo;t you join Miss Tavish in
      this charity? I have no doubt that if it was advertised that Miss Tavish
      and Mr. Jack Delancy would dance for the benefit of an East Side guild in
      the biggest hall in the city, there wouldn&rsquo;t be standing room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo; said Jack, getting up from his chair and striding about the
      room, with more irritation than he had ever shown to Edith before. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t be a prude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith&rsquo;s eyes flashed and her face flushed, but her smile came back in a
      moment, and she was serene again. &ldquo;Come here, Jack. Now, old fellow, look
      me straight in the eyes, and tell me if you would like to have me dance
      the serpentine dance before a drawing-room full of gossiping women, with,
      as you say, just a few men peeping in at the doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack did look, and the serene eyes, yet dancing with amusement at the
      incongruous picture, seemed to take a warmer glow of love and pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it! that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; and he stooped and gave her an awkward
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you know it&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; she said, with a laugh that had not a
      trace of mockery in it; &ldquo;and since you do, you&rsquo;d better go along and do
      your charity, and I&rsquo;ll stay at home, and try to be&mdash;different when
      you come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jack went; with a little feeling of sheepishness that he would not
      have acknowledged at the time, and he found himself in a company where he
      was entirely at his ease. He admired the dancing of the blithe, graceful
      girl, he applauded her as the rest did with hand-clapping and bravas, and
      said it was ravishing. It all suited him perfectly. And somehow, in the
      midst of it all, in the sensuous abandon of this electric-light
      eccentricity at mid-day, he had a fleeting vision of something very
      different, of a womanhood of another sort, and a flush came to his face
      for a moment as he imagined Edith in a skirt dance under the gaze of this
      sensation-loving society. But this was only for a moment. When he
      congratulated Miss Tavish his admiration was entirely sincere; and the
      girl, excited with her physical triumph, seemed to him as one emancipated
      out of acquired prudishness into the Greek enjoyment of life. Miss Tavish,
      who would not for the world have violated one of the social conventions of
      her set, longed, as many women do, for the sort of freedom and the sort of
      applause which belongs to women who succeed upon the stage. Not that she
      would have forfeited her position by dancing at a theatre for money; but;
      within limits, she craved the excitement, the abandon, the admiration,
      that her grace and passion could win. This was not at all the ambition
      which led the Egyptian queen Hatshepsu to assume the dress of a man, but
      rather that more famous aspiration which led the daughter of Herodias, in
      a pleasure-loving court, to imitate and excel the professional
      dancing-girls. If in this inclination of the women of the day, which is
      not new, but has characterized all societies to which wealth has brought
      idleness, there was a note of demoralization, it did not seem so to Jack,
      who found the world day by day more pleasing and more complaisant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the months went by, everything prospered with him on his drifting
      voyage. Of all voyages, that is the easiest to make which has no port in
      view, that depends upon the varying winds, if the winds happen to be soft
      and the chance harbors agreeable. Jack was envied, thanks to Henderson. He
      was lucky in whatever he touched. Without any change in his idle habits,
      and with no more attention to business than formerly, money came to him so
      freely that he not only had a complacent notion that he was a favorite of
      fortune, but the idea of his own importance in the financial world
      increased enormously, much to the amusement of Mavick, when he was
      occasionally in the city, to whom he talked somewhat largely of his
      operations, and who knew that he had no more comprehension of the sweep of
      Henderson&rsquo;s schemes than a baby has of the stock exchange when he claps
      his hands with delight at the click of the ticker.
    </p>
    <p>
      His prosperity was visible. It showed in the increase of his accounts at
      the Union, in his indifference to limits in the game of poker, in a
      handsome pair of horses which he insisted on Edith&rsquo;s accepting for her own
      use, in an increased scale of living at home, in the hundred ways that a
      man of fashion can squander money in a luxurious city. If he did not haunt
      the second-hand book-shops or the stalls of dealers in engravings, or
      bring home as much bric-a-brac as he once had done, it was because his
      mind was otherwise engaged; his tailor&rsquo;s bills were longer, and there were
      more expensive lunches at the clubs, at which there was a great deal of
      sage talk about stocks and combinations, and much wisdom exhibited in
      regard to wines; and then there were the little suppers at Wherry&rsquo;s after
      the theatres, which a bird could have eaten and a fish have drunken, and
      only a spendthrift have paid for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is absurd,&rdquo; Edith had said one night after their return. &ldquo;It makes us
      ridiculous in the eyes of anybody but fools.&rdquo; And Jack had flared up about
      it, and declared that he knew what he could afford, and she had retorted
      that as for her she would not countenance it. And Jack had attempted to
      pass it off lightly, at last, by saying, &ldquo;Very well then, dear, if you
      won&rsquo;t back me, I shall have to rely upon my bankers.&rdquo; At any rate, neither
      Carmen nor Miss Tavish took him to task. They complimented him on his
      taste, and Carmen made him feel that she appreciated his independence and
      his courage in living the life that suited him. She knew, indeed, how much
      he made in his speculations, how much he lost at cards; she knew through
      him the gossip of the clubs, and venturing herself not too far at sea,
      liked to watch the undertow of fashionable life. And she liked Jack, and
      was not incapable of throwing him a rope when the hour came that he was
      likely to be swept away by that undertow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was remarked at the Union, and by the men in the Street who knew him,
      that Jack was getting rapid. But no one thought the less of him for his
      pace&mdash;that is, no one appeared to, for this sort of estimate of a man
      is only tested by his misfortunes, when the day comes that he must seek
      financial backing. In these days he was generally in an expansive mood,
      and his free hand and good-humor increased his popularity. There were
      those who said that there were millions of family money back of Jack, and
      that he had recently come in for something handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this story did not deceive Major Fairfax, whose business it was to
      know to a dot the standing of everybody in society, in which he was a sort
      of oracle and privileged favorite. No one could tell exactly how the Major
      lived; no one knew the rigid economy that he practiced; no one had ever
      seen his small dingy chamber in a cheap lodging-house. The name of Fairfax
      was as good as a letter of introduction in the metropolis, and the Major
      had lived on it for years, on that and a carefully nursed little income&mdash;an
      habitue of the club, and a methodical cultivator of the art of dining out.
      A most agreeable man, and perhaps the wisest man in his generation in
      those things about which it would be as well not to know anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated one afternoon in his favorite corner for street observation, by the
      open window, with the evening paper in his hand, in the attitude of one
      expecting the usual five o&rsquo;clock cocktail, he hailed Jack, who was just
      coming down-stairs from a protracted lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Delancy, what&rsquo;s this I hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo; said Jack, sauntering along to a seat opposite the Major,
      and touching a bell on the little table as he sat down. Jack&rsquo;s face was
      flushed, but he talked with unusual slowness and distinctness. &ldquo;What have
      you heard, Major?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you have bought Benham&rsquo;s yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t; but I was turning the thing over in my mind,&rdquo; Jack
      replied, with the air of a man declining an appointment in the Cabinet.
      &ldquo;He offers it cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, there is no such thing as a cheap yacht, any more than there
      is a cheap elephant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to buy than build,&rdquo; Jack insisted. &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s got to have some
      recreation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recreation! Why don&rsquo;t you charter a Fifth Avenue stage and take your
      friends on a voyage to the Battery? That&rsquo;ll make &lsquo;em sick enough.&rdquo; It was
      a misery of the Major&rsquo;s life that, in order to keep in with necessary
      friends, he had to accept invitations for cruises on yachts, and pretend
      he liked it. Though he had the gout, he vowed he would rather walk to
      Newport than go round Point Judith in one of those tipping tubs. He had
      tried it, and, as he said afterwards, &ldquo;The devil of it was that Mrs.
      Henderson and Miss Tavish sympathized with me. Gad! it takes away a
      person&rsquo;s manhood, that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major sipped his bitters, and then added: &ldquo;Or I&rsquo;ll tell you what; if
      you must do something, start a newspaper&mdash;the drama, society, and
      letters, that sort of thing, with pictures. I heard Miss Tavish say she
      wished she had a newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jack, with gravity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not buying a yacht for Miss Tavish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you were. Devilish fine girl, though. I don&rsquo;t care who
      you buy it for if you don&rsquo;t buy it for yourself. Why don&rsquo;t you buy it for
      Henderson? He can afford it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what you mean, Major Fairfax!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;What
      business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major, sinking back in his chair, with a softened
      expression in his society beaten face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use of nonsense, Jack. I&rsquo;m
      an average old sinner, and I&rsquo;m not old enough yet to like a milksop. But
      I&rsquo;ve known you since you were so high, and I knew your father; he used to
      stay weeks on my plantation when we were both younger. And your mother&mdash;that
      was a woman!&mdash;did me a kindness once when I was in a d&mdash;-d tight
      place, and I never forgot it. See here, Jack, if I had money enough I&rsquo;d
      buy a yacht and put Carmen and Miss Tavish on it, and send them off on the
      longest voyage there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been talking?&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, touched a little, but very much
      offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The town, Jack. Don&rsquo;t mind the talk. People always talk. I suppose people
      talk about me: At your age I should have been angry too at a hint even
      from an old friend. But I&rsquo;ve learned. It doesn&rsquo;t pay. I don&rsquo;t get angry
      any more. Now there&rsquo;s Henderson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got against Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. He is a very good fellow, for that sort of man. But, Lord!
      Henderson is a big machine. You might as well try to stand in with a
      combination of gang-saws, or to make friends with the Department of the
      Interior. Look at the men who have gone in with Henderson from time to
      time. The ground is strewn with them. He&rsquo;s got no more feeling in business
      than a reaper-and-binder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Henderson&rsquo;s got to do with my having a yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Jack; it&rsquo;s none of my business. Only I do not put my
      investments&rdquo;&mdash;Jack smiled faintly, as if the conversation were taking
      a humorous turn&mdash;&ldquo;at the mercy of Henderson&rsquo;s schemes. If I did, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t try to run a yacht at the same time. I should be afraid that some
      day when I got to sea I should find myself out of coal. You know, my boy,
      that the good book says you cannot serve two masters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody ever accused you of that, Major,&rdquo; retorted Jack, with a laugh.
      &ldquo;But what two have you in mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean anything personal. I just use names as typical. Say
      Henderson and Carmen.&rdquo; And the Major leaned back and tapped his fingers
      together, as if he were putting a general proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack flushed, and then thought a moment&mdash;it would be ridiculous to
      get angry with old Fairfax&mdash;and then said: &ldquo;Major, if I were you, I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with either of them. You&rsquo;ll spoil your
      digestion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; the Major grunted, as he rose from his chair. &ldquo;This is an age of
      impudence. There&rsquo;s no more respect for gray hair than if it were dyed. I
      cannot waste any more time on you. I&rsquo;ve got an early dinner. Devilish
      uphill work trying to encourage people who dine at seven. But, my boy,
      think on these things, as the saint says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old fellow limped away. There was one good thing about the Major.
      He stood up in church every Sunday and read his prayers, like a faithful
      old sinner as he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, sobered by the talk, walked home in a very irritated mood, blaming
      everybody except himself. For old Fairfax&rsquo;s opinion he didn&rsquo;t care, but
      evidently the old fellow represented a lot of gossip. He wished people
      would mind their own business. His irritation was a little appeased by
      Edith&rsquo;s gay and loving greeting; but she, who knew every shade of his
      face, saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had a worrying day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not specially. I&rsquo;ve had an hour of old Fairfax, who hasn&rsquo;t any
      business of his own to attend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nobody minds the Major,&rdquo; Edith said, as she gave him a shake and
      another kiss; but a sharp pang went through her heart, for she guessed
      what had happened, since she had had a visit that afternoon from another
      plain-speaking person.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were staying late in town. Edith, who did not care to travel far, was
      going presently to a little cottage by the sea, and Mrs. Schuyler Blunt
      had looked in for a moment to say good-by before she went up to her Lenox
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only an old farmhouse made over,&rdquo; Mrs. Blunt was saying; &ldquo;hardly
      smart enough to ask anybody to, but we hope to have you and Jack there
      some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be very nice. I hear Lenox is more beautiful than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is, and about as difficult to get into as the kingdom of heaven.
      It&rsquo;s being spoiled for moderate people. The Hendersons and the Van Dams
      and that sort are in a race to see who shall build houses with the biggest
      rooms, and give the most expensive entertainments. It&rsquo;s all show. The old
      flavor has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they cannot spoil the scenery.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child, they are the scenery. You can&rsquo;t see anything else. It doesn&rsquo;t
      bother me, but some of my old neighbors are just ruining themselves trying
      to keep the pace. I do think the Americans are the biggest fools on
      earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Damon says the trouble is we haven&rsquo;t any middle class for a
      balance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the English of it. But it&rsquo;s a pity that fashion has got hold
      of the country, and is turning our summers into a worry and a burden. I
      thought years ago when we went to Lenox that it was a good thing the
      country was getting to be the fashion; but now it&rsquo;s fashionable, and
      before we know it every desirable spot will be what they call syndicated.
      Miss Tavish says she is coming to visit the Hendersons there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she went to Bar Harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is coming down for part of the season. These people don&rsquo;t stay
      anywhere. Just long enough in one place to upset everything with their
      extravagance. That&rsquo;s the reason I didn&rsquo;t ask you and Jack up this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, we couldn&rsquo;t go, you know,&rdquo; said Edith, simply, and then, with
      curiosity in her eyes, asked; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t quite understand what&rsquo;s the
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blunt, as if nerving herself up to say what must be
      said, &ldquo;I thought perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t like to be where they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should or why I should not,&rdquo; Edith replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor have Jack with them,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Blunt, stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Mrs. Blunt?&rdquo; cried Edith, her brown eyes flaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t turn on me, Edith dear. I oughtn&rsquo;t to have said anything. But I
      thought it was my duty. Of course it is only talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Jack is always with one or the other of those women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is false!&rdquo; cried Edith, starting up, with tears now in her eyes; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      a cruel lie if it means anything wrong in Jack. So am I with those women;
      so are you. It&rsquo;s a shame. If you hear any one say such things, you can
      tell them for me that I despise them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said it was a shame, all such talk. I said it was nonsense. But, dear,
      as a friend, oughtn&rsquo;t I to tell you?&rdquo; And the kind-hearted gossip put her
      arm round Edith, and kept saying that she perfectly understood it, and
      that nobody really meant anything. But Edith was crying now, with a heart
      both hurt and indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most hateful world, I know,&rdquo; Mrs. Blunt answered; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s the
      best we have, and it&rsquo;s no use to fret about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the visitor had gone, Edith sat a long time in misery. It was the
      first real shock of her married life. And in her heart she prayed. For
      Jack? Oh no. The dear girl prayed for herself, that suspicions might not
      enter her heart. She could not endure that the world should talk thus of
      him. That was all. And when she had thought it all over and grown calm,
      she went to her desk and wrote a note to Carmen. It asked Mrs. Henderson,
      as they were so soon to leave town, to do her the favor to come round
      informally and lunch with her the next day, and afterwards perhaps a
      little drive in the Park.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jack was grateful for Edith&rsquo;s intervention. He comprehended that she had
      stepped forward as a shield to him in the gossip about Carmen. He showed
      his appreciation in certain lover-like attentions and in a gayety of
      manner, but it was not in his nature to feel the sacrifice she had made or
      its full magnanimity; he was relieved, and in a manner absolved. Another
      sort of woman might have made him very uncomfortable. Instead of being
      rebuked he had a new sense of freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one woman in a thousand would have done it,&rdquo; was the comment of Major
      Fairfax when he heard of the drive in the Park. &ldquo;Gad! most of &lsquo;em would
      have cut Carmen dead and put Jack in Coventry, and then there would have
      been the devil to pay. It takes quality, though; she&rsquo;s such a woman as
      Jack&rsquo;s mother. If there were not one of them now and then society would
      deliquesce.&rdquo; And the Major knew, for his principal experience had been
      with a deliquescent society.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0153}.jpg" alt="{0153}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0153}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Whether Carmen admired Mrs. Delancy or thought her weak it is impossible
      to say, but she understood the advances made and responded to them, for
      they fell in perfectly with her social plans. She even had the face to
      eulogize Mrs. Delancy to Jack, her breadth of view, her lack of prejudice,
      and she had even dared to say, &ldquo;My dear friend, she is too good for us,&rdquo;
       and Jack had not protested, but with a laugh had accepted the implication
      of his position on a lower moral level. Perhaps he did not see exactly
      what it meant, this being on confidential terms about his wife with
      another woman; all he cared for at the moment was that the comradeship of
      Miss Tavish and Carmen was agreeable to him. They were no restraint upon
      him. So long as they remained in town the exchange of civilities was kept
      up. Carmen and Miss Tavish were often at his house, and there was
      something reassuring to Jack in the openness with which affairs went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in June Edith went down to their rented cottage on the south Long
      Island shore. In her delicate health the doctor had recommended the
      seaside, and this locality as quiet and restful, and not too far from the
      whirl of the city. The place had a charm of its own, the charm, namely, of
      a wide sky, illimitable, flashing, changing sea, rolling in from the far
      tropical South with its message of romance to the barren Northern shore,
      and the pure sand dunes, the product of the whippings of tempests and wild
      weather. The cottage was in fact an old farmhouse, not an impertinent,
      gay, painted piece of architecture set on the sand like a tent for a
      month, but a solid, ugly, fascinating habitation, with barns and
      outhouses, and shrubs, and an old garden&mdash;a place with a salty air
      friendly to delicate spring blossoms and summer fruits and foliage. If it
      was a farmhouse, the sea was an important part of the farm, and the
      low-ceiled rooms suggested cabins; it required little imagination to fancy
      that an East-Indian ship had some time come ashore and settled in the
      sand, that it had been remodeled and roofed over, and its sides pierced
      with casement windows, over which roses had climbed in order to bind the
      wanderer to the soil. It had been painted by the sun and the wind and the
      salt air, so that its color depended upon the day, and it was sometimes
      dull and almost black, or blue-black, under a lowering sky, and again a
      golden brown, especially at sunset, and Edith, feeling its character
      rather than its appearance to ordinary eyes, had named it the Golden
      House. Nature is such a beautiful painter of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Edith went one of her Baltimore cousins, a young kindergarten teacher
      of fine intelligence and sympathetic manner, who brought to her work a
      long tradition of gentle breeding and gayety and simplicity&mdash;qualities
      which all children are sure to recognize. What a hopeful thing it is,
      by-the-way, in the world, that all conditions of people know a lady at
      sight! Jack found the place delightful. He liked its quaintness, the
      primitiveness of the farmer-fisherman neighbors, he liked the sea. And
      then he could run up to the city any morning and back at night. He spent
      the summer with Edith at the Golden House. This was his theory. When he
      went to town in the morning he expected to return at night. But often he
      telegraphed in the afternoon that he was detained by business; he had to
      see Henderson, or Mavick was over from Washington. Occasionally, but not
      often, he missed the train. He had too keen a sense of the ridiculous to
      miss the train often. When he was detained over for two or three days, or
      the better part of the week, he wrote Edith dashing, hurried letters,
      speaking of ever so many places he had been to and ever so many people he
      had seen&mdash;yes, Carmen and Miss Tavish and everybody who was in town,
      and he did not say too much about the hot city and its discomforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson&rsquo;s affairs kept him in town, Miss Tavish still postponed Bar
      Harbor, and Carmen willingly remained. She knew the comfort of a big New
      York house when the season is over, when no social duties are required,
      and one is at leisure to lounge about in cool costumes, to read or dream,
      to open the windows at night for the salt breeze from the bay, to take
      little excursions by boat or rail, to dine al fresco in the garden of some
      semi-foreign hotel, to taste the unconventional pleasures of the town, as
      if one were in some foreign city. She used to say that New York in matting
      and hollands was almost as nice as Buda-Pesth. These were really summer
      nights, operatic sorts of nights, with music floating in the air, gay
      groups in the streets, a stage imitation of nature in the squares with the
      thick foliage and the heavy shadows cast on the asphalt by the electric
      lights, the brilliant shops, the nonsense of the summer theatres, where no
      one expected anything, and no one was disappointed, the general air of
      enjoyment, and the suggestion of intrigue. Sometimes, when Mavick was
      over, a party was made up for the East Side, to see the foreign costumes,
      the picturesque street markets, the dime museums, and the serious,
      tragical theatres of the people. The East Side was left pretty much to
      itself, now that the winter philanthropists had gone away, and was
      enjoying its summer nights and its irresponsible poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      They even looked in at Father Damon&rsquo;s chapel, the dimly lighted fragrant
      refuge from the world and from sin. Why not? They were interested in the
      morals of the region. Had not Miss Tavish danced for one of the guilds;
      and had not Carmen given Father Damon a handsome check in support of his
      mission? It was so satisfactory to go into such a place and see the
      penitents kneeling here and there, the little group of very plainly
      dressed sinners attracted by Father Damon&rsquo;s spiritual face and unselfish
      enthusiasm. Carmen said she felt like kneeling at one of the little boxes
      and confessing&mdash;the sins of her neighbors. And then the four&mdash;Carmen,
      Miss Tavish, Mavick, and Jack&mdash;had a little supper at Wherry&rsquo;s, which
      they enjoyed all the more for the good action of visiting the East Side&mdash;a
      little supper which lasted very late, and was more and more enjoyed as it
      went on, and was, in fact, so gay that when the ladies were set down at
      their houses, Jack insisted on dragging Mavick off to the Beefsteak Club
      and having something manly to drink; and while they drank he analyzed the
      comparative attractions of Carmen and Miss Tavish; he liked that kind of
      women, no nonsense in them; and presently he wandered a little and lost
      the cue of his analysis, and, seizing Mavick by the arm, and regarding him
      earnestly, in a burst of confidence declared that, notwithstanding all
      appearances, Edith was the dearest girl in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this supper that the famous society was formed, which the
      newspapers ridiculed, and which deceived so many excellent people in New
      York because it seemed to be in harmony with the philanthropic endeavor of
      the time, but which was only an expression of the Mephistophelian spirit
      of Carmen&mdash;the Society for Supplying Two Suspenders to Those who have
      only One.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of June there was no more doubt about the heat of the town than
      about its odors. The fashionable residence part was dismantled and
      deserted. At least miles and miles of houses seemed to be closed. Few
      carriages were seen in this quarter, the throngs of fashion had
      disappeared, comparatively few women were about, and those that appeared
      in the Sunday promenade were evidently sight-seers and idlers from other
      quarters; the throng of devotees was gone from the churches, and indeed in
      many of them services were suspended till a more convenient season. The
      hotels, to be sure, were full of travelers, and the club-houses had more
      habitues than usual, and were more needed by the members whose families
      had gone into the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the silence and vacation aspect of up-town, the public
      conveyances were still thronged, and a census would have shown no such
      diminution of population as seemed. Indeed, while nobody was in town,
      except accidentally, the greater portion of it presented a more animated
      appearance than usual, especially at night, on account of the open
      windows, the groups on door-steps and curb-stones, and the restless throng
      in the streets-buyers and sellers and idlers. To most this outdoor life
      was a great enjoyment, and to them the unclean streets with the odors and
      exhalations of decay were homelike and congenial. Nor did they seem
      surprised that a new country should so completely reproduce the evil
      smells and nastiness of the old civilization. It was all familiar and
      picturesque. Work still went on in the crowded tenement-houses, and
      sickness simply changed its character, death showing an increased
      friendliness to young children. Some impression was of course made by the
      agents of various charities, the guilds and settlements bravely strove at
      their posts, some of the churches kept their flags flying on the borders
      of the industrial districts, the Good Samaritans of the Fresh-air Fund
      were active, the public dispensaries did a thriving business, and the
      little band of self-sacrificing doctors, most of them women, went their
      rounds among the poor, the sick, and the friendless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them Ruth Leigh was one who never took a vacation. There was no time
      for it. The greater the heat, the more noisome the town, the more people
      became ill from decaying food and bad air and bad habits, the more people
      were hungry from improvidence or lack of work, the more were her daily
      visits a necessity; and though she was weary of her monotonous work, and
      heart-sick at its small result in such a mass, there never came a day when
      she could quit it. She made no reputation in her profession by this
      course; perhaps she awoke little gratitude from those she served, and
      certainly had not so much of their confidence as the quacks who imposed
      upon them and took their money; and she was not heartened much by hope of
      anything better in this world or any other; and as for pay, if there was
      enough of that to clothe her decently, she apparently did not spend it on
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in short, wholly inexplicable that this little woman should simply
      go about doing good, without any ulterior purpose whatever, not even
      notoriety. Did she love these people? She did not ever say anything about
      that. In the Knights of Labor circle, and in the little clubs for the
      study of social questions, which she could only get leisure to attend
      infrequently, she was not at all demonstrative about any religion of
      humanity. Perhaps she simply felt that she was a part of these people, and
      that whether they rejected her or received her, there was nothing for her
      to do but to give herself to them. She would probably have been surprised
      if Father Damon had told her that she was in this following a great
      example, and there might have been a tang of agnostic bitterness in her
      reply. When she thought of it the condition seemed to her hopeless, and
      the attitude of what was called civilization towards it so remorseless and
      indifferent, and that of Christianity so pharisaical. If she ever lost her
      temper, it was when she let her mind run in this nihilistic channel, in
      bitterness against the whole social organization, and the total outcome of
      civilization so far as the mass of humanity is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Father Damon climbed up to the top of a wretched tenement in
      Baxter Street in search of a German girl, an impulsive and pretty girl of
      fifteen, whom he had missed for several days at the chapel services. He
      had been in the room before. It was not one of the worst, for though small
      and containing a cook-stove, a large bed, and a chest of drawers, there
      was an attempt to make it tidy. In a dark closet opening out from it was
      another large bed. As he knocked and opened the door, he saw that Gretchen
      was not at home. Her father sat in a rocking-chair by an open window, on
      the sill of which stood a pot of carnations, the Easter gift of St.
      George&rsquo;s, a wax-faced, hollow-eyed man of gentle manners, who looked round
      wearily at the priest. The mother was washing clothes in a tub in one
      corner; in another corner was a half-finished garment from a slop-shop.
      The woman alternated the needle at night and the tub in the daytime.
      Seated on the bed, with a thin, sick child in her arms, was Dr. Leigh. As
      she looked up a perfectly radiant smile illuminated her usually plain
      face, an unworldly expression of such purity and happiness that she seemed
      actually beautiful to the priest, who stopped, hesitating, upon the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t be afraid to come in, Father Damon,&rdquo; she cried out; &ldquo;it
      isn&rsquo;t contagious&mdash;only rash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon, who would as readily have walked through a pestilence as in
      a flower-garden, only smiled at this banter, and replied, after speaking
      to the sick man, and returning in German the greeting of the woman, who
      had turned from the tub, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no doubt you are disappointed that it isn&rsquo;t
      contagious!&rdquo; And then, to the mother: &ldquo;Where is Gretchen? She doesn&rsquo;t come
      to the chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nein,&rdquo; replied the woman, in a mixture of German and English, &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t
      come any more in dot place; it be in a shtore now; it be good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, all day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yaas, by six o&rsquo;clock, and abends so spate. Not much it get, but my man
      can&rsquo;t earn nothing any more.&rdquo; And the woman, as she looked at him, wiped
      her eyes with the corner of her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, on Sunday?&rdquo; Father Damon asked, still further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, it be so tired, and goed up by de Park with Dick Loosing and dem
      oder girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it better, Father Damon,&rdquo; Dr. Leigh interposed, &ldquo;that
      Gretchen should have fresh air and some recreation on Sunday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Und such bootiful tings by de Museum,&rdquo; added the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, with something like a frown on his face, and then
      changed the subject to the sick child. He did not care to argue the matter
      when Dr. Leigh was present, but he resolved to come again and explain to
      the mother that her daughter needed some restraining power other than her
      own impulse, and that without religious guidance she was pretty certain to
      drift into frivolous and vulgar if not positively bad ways. The father was
      a free-thinker; but Father Damon thought he had some hold on the mother,
      who was of the Lutheran communion, but had followed her husband so far as
      to become indifferent to anything but their daily struggle for life. Yet
      she had a mother&rsquo;s instinct about the danger to her daughter, and had been
      pleased to have her go to Father Damon&rsquo;s chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, besides, he could not bring himself in that presence to seem to
      rebuke Ruth Leigh. Was she not practically doing what his Lord did&mdash;going
      about healing the sick, sympathizing with the poor and the discouraged,
      taking upon herself the burden of the disconsolate, literally, without
      thought of self, sharing, as it were, the misery and sin of this awful
      city? And today, for the first time, he seemed to have seen the woman in
      her&mdash;or was it the saint? and he recalled that wonderful illumination
      of her plain face that made her actually beautiful as she looked up from
      the little waif of humanity she held in her arms. It had startled him, and
      struck a new chord in his heart, and planted a new pang there that she had
      no belief in a future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not occur to him that the sudden joy in her face might have been
      evoked by seeing him, for it was a long time since she had seen him. Nor
      did he think that the pang at his heart had another cause than religious
      anxiety. Ah, priest and worldly saint, how subtle and enduring are the
      primal instincts of human nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, as they walked away, in reply to her inquiry as to his
      absence, &ldquo;I have been in retreat a couple of weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said, softly, &ldquo;you needed the rest; though,&rdquo; and she
      looked at him professionally, &ldquo;if you will allow me to say it, it seems to
      me that you have not rested enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needed strength&rdquo;&mdash;and it was the priest that spoke&mdash;&ldquo;in
      meditation and prayer to draw upon resources not my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in fasting, too, I dare say,&rdquo; she added, with a little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to know what you need. I need to
      eat, though Heaven knows it&rsquo;s hard enough to keep up an appetite down
      here. But it is physical endurance you need for the work here. Do you
      think fasting strengthens you to go through your work night and day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I couldn&rsquo;t do it on my own strength.&rdquo; And Dr. Leigh recalled times
      when she had seen him officiating in the chapel apparently sustained by
      nothing but zeal and pure spirit, and wondered that he did not faint and
      fall. And faint and fall he did, she was sure, when the service was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it may be necessary to you, but not as an example to these people.
      I see enough involuntary fasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We look at these people from different points of view, I fear.&rdquo; And after
      a moment he said: &ldquo;But, doctor, I wanted to ask you about Gretchen. You
      see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occasionally. She works too many hours, but she seems to be getting on
      very well, and brings her mother all she earns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she is able to stand alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Leigh winced a little at this searching question, for no one knew
      better than she the vulgarizing influence of street life and chance
      associations upon a young girl, and the temptations. She was even forced
      to admit the value in the way of restraint, as a sort of police force, of
      the church and priestly influence, especially upon girls at the
      susceptible age. But she knew that Father Damon meant something more than
      this, and so she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But people have got to stand alone. She might as well begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is so young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. She is in the way of temptation, but so long as she works
      industriously, and loves her mother, and feels the obligation, which the
      poor very easily feel, of doing her share for the family, she is not in so
      much moral danger as other girls of her age who lead idle and
      self-indulgent lives. The working-girls of the city learn to protect
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think this is enough, without any sort of religion&mdash;that
      this East Side can go on without any spiritual life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth Leigh made a gesture of impatience. In view of the actual struggle
      for existence she saw around her, this talk seemed like cant. And she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that anything can go on. Let me ask you a question, Father
      Damon. Do you think there is any more spirituality, any more of the
      essentials of what you call Christianity, in the society of the other side
      than there is on the East Side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a deep question, this of spirituality,&rdquo; replied Father Damon, who
      was in the depths of his proselyting action a democrat and in sympathy
      with the people, and rated quite at its full value the conventional
      fashion in religion. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to judge, but there is a great body
      of Christian men and women in this city who are doing noble work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the little doctor, bitterly, &ldquo;trying to save themselves.
      How many are trying to save others&mdash;others except the distant and
      foreign sinners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely cannot ignore,&rdquo; replied the father, still speaking mildly,
      &ldquo;the immense amount of charitable work done by the churches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; charity, charity, the condescension of the rich to the poor.
      What we want are understanding, fellowship, and we get alms! If there is
      so much spirituality as you say, and Christianity is what you say it is
      today, how happens it that this side is left in filth and misery and
      physical wretchedness? You know what it is, and you know the luxury
      elsewhere. And you think to bridge over the chasm between classes with
      flowers, in pots, yes, and Bible-readers and fashionable visitors and
      little aid societies&mdash;little palliatives for an awful state of
      things. Why, look at it! Last winter the city authorities hauled off the
      snow and the refuse from the fashionable avenues, and dumped it down in
      the already blockaded and filthy side streets, and left us to struggle
      with the increased pneumonia and diphtheria, and general unsanitary
      conditions. And you wonder that the little nihilist groups and labor
      organizations and associations of agnostics, as you call them, meeting to
      study political economy and philosophy, say that the existing state of
      things has got to be overturned violently, if those who have the power and
      the money continue indifferent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wonder,&rdquo; replied Father Damon, sadly. &ldquo;The world is evil, and I
      should be as despairing as you are if I did not know there was another
      life and another world. I couldn&rsquo;t bear it. Nobody could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all you&rsquo;ve got to offer, then, to this mass of wretchedness, poverty,
      ignorance, at close quarters with hunger and disease, is to grin and bear
      it, in hope of a reward somewhere else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you don&rsquo;t quite&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked up and saw a look of pain on the priest&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she hastened to say, almost as impetuously as she had spoken before,
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean you&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean you. I know what you do. Pardon me
      for speaking so. I get so discouraged sometimes.&rdquo; They stood still a
      moment, looking up and down the hot, crowded, odorful street they were in,
      with its flaunting rags of poverty and inefficiency. &ldquo;I see so little
      result of what I can do, and there is so little help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the father, as they moved along. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can
      bear it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This touched a sore spot, and aroused Ruth Leigh&rsquo;s combativeness. It
      seemed to her to approach the verge of cant again. But she knew the
      father&rsquo;s absolute sincerity; she felt she had already said too much; and
      she only murmured, as if to herself, &ldquo;If we could only know.&rdquo; And then,
      after a moment, she asked, &ldquo;Do you, Father Damon, see any sign of anything
      better here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, today.&rdquo; And he spoke very slowly and hesitatingly. &ldquo;If you will
      excuse the personality of it. When I entered that room today, and saw you
      with that sick child in your arms, and comprehended what it all meant, I
      had a great wave of hope, and I knew, just then, that there is coming
      virtue enough in the world to redeem it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was confounded. Her heart seemed to stand still, and then the hot
      blood flowed into her face in a crimson flood. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; escaped from her
      lips, and she walked on more swiftly, not daring to look up. This from
      him! This recognition from the ascetic father! If one of her dispensary
      comrades had said it, would she have been so moved?
    </p>
    <p>
      And afterwards, when she had parted from him, and gone to her little room,
      the hot flush again came to her neck and brow, and she saw his pale,
      spiritual face, and could hear the unwonted tenderness of his voice. Yes,
      Father Damon had said it of her.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The question has been very much discussed whether the devil, in temperate
      latitudes, is busier in the summer or in the winter. When Congress and the
      various State legislatures are in session, and the stock and grain
      exchanges are most active, and society is gayest, and the churches and
      benevolent and reformatory associations are most aggressive&mdash;at this
      season, which is the cool season, he seems to be most animated and
      powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But is not this because he is then most opposed? The stream may not flow
      any faster because it is dammed, but it exhibits at the obstructed points
      greater appearance of agitation. Many people are under the impression that
      when they stop fighting there is a general truce: There is reason to
      believe that the arch enemy is pleased with this impression, that he likes
      a truce, and that it is his best opportunity, just as the weeds in the
      garden, after a tempest, welcome the sun and the placidity of the
      elements. It is well known that in summer virtue suffers from inertia, and
      that it is difficult to assemble the members of any vigilant organization,
      especially in cities, where the flag of the enemy is never lowered. But
      wherever the devil is there is always a quorum present for business. It is
      not his plan to seek an open fight, and many observers say that he gains
      more ground in summer than in any other season, and this notwithstanding
      people are more apt to lose their tempers, and even become profane, in the
      aggravations of what is known as spring than at any other time. The
      subject cannot be pursued here, but there is ground for supposing that the
      devil prefers a country where the temperature is high and pretty uniform.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, it is true that the development of character is not arrested
      by any geniality or languor of nature. By midsummer the Hendersons were
      settled in Lenox, where the Blunts had long been, and Miss Tavish and her
      party of friends were at Bar Harbor. Henderson was compelled to be in the
      city most of the time, and Jack Delancy fancied that business required his
      presence there also; but he had bought a yacht, and contemplated a voyage,
      with several of the club men, up the Maine coast. &ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; Major
      Fairfax had said; &ldquo;I know an easier way to get to Bar Harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack was irritable and restless, to be sure, in the absence of the sort of
      female society he had become accustomed to; but there were many
      compensations in his free-and-easy bachelor life, in his pretense of
      business, which consisted in watching the ticker, as it is called, in an
      occasional interview with Henderson, and in the floating summer amusements
      of the relaxed city. There was nothing unusual in this life except that he
      needed a little more stimulation, but this was not strange in the summer,
      and that he devoted more time to poker&mdash;but everybody knows that a
      person comes out about even in the game of poker if he keeps at it long
      enough&mdash;there was nothing unusual in this, only it was giving Jack a
      distaste for the quiet and it seemed to him the restraint of the Golden
      House down by the sea. And he was more irritable there than elsewhere. It
      is so difficult to estimate an interior deterioration of this sort, for
      Jack was just as popular with his comrades as ever, and apparently more
      prosperous.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0175}.jpg" alt="{0175}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0175}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      It is true that Jack had had other ideas when he was courting Edith
      Fletcher, and at moments, at any rate, different aspirations from any he
      had now. With her at that time there had been nobler aspirations about
      life. But now she was his wife. That was settled. And not only that, but
      she was the best woman he knew; and if she were not his wife, he would
      spare no effort to win her. He felt sure of that. He did not put it to
      himself in the way an Oriental would do, &ldquo;That is finished&rdquo;; but it was an
      act done&mdash;a good act&mdash;and here was his world again, with a
      hundred interests, and there were people besides Edith to be thought of,
      other women and men, and affairs. Because a man was married, was he to be
      shut up to one little narrow career, that of husband? Probably it did not
      occur to him that women take a different view of this in the singleness of
      their purpose and faith. Edith, for instance, knew or guessed that Jack
      had no purpose in life that was twenty-four hours old; but she had faith&mdash;and
      no amount of observation destroys this faith in women&mdash;that marriage
      would inspire him with energy and ambition to take a man&rsquo;s place in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      With most men marriage is un fait accompli. Jack had been lucky, but there
      was, no doubt, truth in an observation of Mavick&rsquo;s. One night as they sat
      at the club Jack had asked him a leading question, apropos of Henderson&rsquo;s
      successful career: &ldquo;Mavick, why don&rsquo;t you get married?&rdquo; &ldquo;I have never,&rdquo; he
      replied, with his usual cynical deliberation, &ldquo;been obliged to. The fact
      is, marriage is a curb-bit. Some horses show off better with it, and some
      are enraged and kick over the traces. I cannot decide which I would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;from a bachelor&rsquo;s point of view of
      independence, but it&rsquo;s really a question of matching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most difficult thing in the world&mdash;in horses. Just about
      impossible in temperament and movement, let alone looks. Most men are
      lucky if they get, like Henderson, a running mate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Jack, who knew something about the Henderson household,
      &ldquo;your idea of a pair is that they should go single.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mavick laughed, and said something about the ideas of women changing so
      much lately that nobody could tell what the relation of marriage would
      become, and Jack, who began to feel that he was disloyal, changed the
      subject. To do him justice, he would have been ashamed for Edith to hear
      this sort of flippant and shallow talk, which wouldn&rsquo;t have been at all
      out of place with Carmen or Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask you, Mavick, as a friend, do you think Henderson is
      square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody is safe. Henderson is as safe as anybody. You can rely on what he
      says. But there&rsquo;s a good deal he doesn&rsquo;t say. Anything wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know. I&rsquo;ve been pretty lucky. But the fact is, I&rsquo;ve gone in
      rather deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a game. Henderson plays it, as everybody does, for himself. I
      like Henderson. He plays to win, and generally does. But, you know, if one
      man wins, somebody else has got to lose in this kind of industry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Henderson looks out for his friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;when it doesn&rsquo;t cost too much. Times may come when a man has to
      look out for himself. Wealth isn&rsquo;t made out of nothing. There must be
      streams into the reservoir. These great accumulations of one&mdash;you can
      see that&mdash;must be made up of countless other men&rsquo;s small savings.
      There&rsquo;s Uncle Jerry. He operates a good deal with Henderson, and they&rsquo;d
      incline to help each other out. But Uncle Jerry says he&rsquo;s got a small pond
      of his own, and he&rsquo;s careful not to connect it with Henderson&rsquo;s
      reservoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of Missouri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I think of the Milky Way? It doesn&rsquo;t much matter to me what
      becomes of Missouri, unless Henderson should happen to get smashed in it,
      and that isn&rsquo;t what he is there for. But when you look at the
      combinations, and the dropping-off of roads that have been drained, and
      the scaling down in refunding, and the rearranging, and the strikes, how
      much chance do you think the small fry stand? I don&rsquo;t doubt that Henderson
      will make a big thing out of it, and there will be lots of howling by
      those who were not so smart, and the newspapers will say that Henderson
      was too strong for them. What we respect nowadays are adroitness and
      strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an exciting game,&rdquo; Mavick continued, after a moment&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;Let me
      know if you get uneasy. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Jack; if I had a
      comfortable income, I wouldn&rsquo;t risk it in any speculation. There is a good
      deal that is interesting going on in this world, and I like to be in it;
      but the best plan for a man who has anything is, as Uncle Jerry says, to
      sail close and salt down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that Mavick&rsquo;s connection with Henderson was an appreciable
      addition to his income, and it was not a bad thing for Henderson. Mavick&rsquo;s
      reputation for knowing the inside of everything and being close-mouthed
      actually brought him confidences; that which at first was a clever
      assumption became a reality, and his reputation was so established for
      being behind the scenes that he was not believed when he honestly
      professed ignorance of anything. His modest disclaimer merely increased
      the impression that he was deep. Henderson himself had something of the
      Bismarck trait of brutal, contemptuous frankness. Mavick was never brutal
      and never contemptuous, but he had a cynical sort of frankness, which is a
      good deal more effectual in a business way than the oily, plausible manner
      which on &lsquo;Change, as well as in politics, is distrusted as hypocrisy. Now
      Uncle Jerry Hollowell was neither oily nor frank; he was long-headed and
      cautious, and had a reputation for shrewdness and just enough of
      plasticity of conscience to remove him out of the list of the
      impracticable and over-scrupulous. This reputation that business men and
      politicians acquire would be a very curious study. The world is very
      complacent, and apparently worships success and votes for smartness, but
      it would surprise some of our most successful men to know what a real
      respect there is in the community, after all, for downright integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Jack, who fell into the current notion of his generation of young men
      that the Henderson sort of morality was best adapted to quick success,
      evinced a consciousness of want of nobility in the course he was pursuing
      by not making Edith his confidante. He would have said, of course, that
      she knew nothing about business, but what he meant was that she had a very
      clear conception of what was honest. All the evidences of his prosperity,
      shown in his greater freedom of living, were sore trials to her. She
      belonged to that old class of New-Yorkers who made trade honorable, like
      the merchants of Holland and Venice, and she knew also that Jack&rsquo;s little
      fortune had come out of honest toil and strict business integrity. Could
      there be any happiness in life in any other course?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed cruel to put such a problem as this upon a young woman hardly
      yet out of girlhood, in the first flush of a new life, which she had
      dreamed should be so noble and high and so happy, in the period which is
      consecrated by the sweetest and loveliest visions and hopes that ever come
      into a woman&rsquo;s life.

      As the summer wore on to its maximum of heat and discomfort in the city,
      Edith, who never forgot to measure the hardships of others by her own more
      fortunate circumstances, urged Dr. Leigh to come away from her labors and
      rest a few days by the sea. The reply was a refusal, but there was no
      complaint in the brief business-like note. One might have supposed that it
      was the harvest-time of the doctor, if he had not known that she gathered
      nothing for herself. There had never been so much sickness, she wrote, and
      such an opportunity for her. She was learning a great deal, especially
      about some disputed contagious diseases. She would like to see Mrs.
      Delancy, and she wouldn&rsquo;t mind a breath of air that was more easily to be
      analyzed than that she existed in, but nothing could induce her to give up
      her cases. All that appeared in her letter was her interest in her
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon, who had been persuaded by Edith&rsquo;s urgency to go down with
      Jack for a few days to the Golden House, seemed uncommonly interested in
      the reasons of Dr. Leigh&rsquo;s refusal to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so cheerful. The more sickness there is, the
      more radiant she is. I don&rsquo;t mean,&rdquo; he added, laughing, &ldquo;in apparel.
      Apparently she never thinks of herself, and positively she seems to take
      no time to eat or sleep. I encounter her everywhere. I doubt if she ever
      sits down, except when she drops in at the mission chapel now and then,
      and sits quite unmoved on a bench by the door during vespers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she does go there?&rdquo; said Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a queer thing. She would promptly repudiate any religious
      interest. But I tell her she is a bit of a humbug. When I speak about her
      philanthropic zeal, she says her interest is purely scientific.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, I believe,&rdquo; Jack put in, &ldquo;that women doctors are less mercenary
      than men. I dare say they will get over that when the novelty of coming
      into the profession has worn off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is possible,&rdquo; said Father Damon; &ldquo;but that which drives women into
      professions now is the desire to do something rather than the desire to
      make something. Besides, it is seldom, in their minds, a finality;
      marriage is always a possibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Edith, &ldquo;and the probability of having to support a husband
      and family; then they may be as mercenary as men are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, the enthusiasm of women,&rdquo; Father Damon insisted, &ldquo;in hospital and
      outdoor practice, the singleness of their devotion to it, is in contrast
      to that of the young men-doctors. And I notice another thing in the city:
      they take more interest in philanthropic movements, in the condition of
      the poor, in the labor questions; they dive eagerly into philosophic
      speculations, and they are more aggressively agnostics. And they are not
      afraid of any social theories. I have one friend, a skillful practitioner
      they tell me, a linguist, and a metaphysician, a most agreeable and
      accomplished woman, who is in theory an extreme nihilist, and looks to see
      the present social and political order upset.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; Jack remarked, &ldquo;what women especially are to gain by such a
      revolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps independence, Jack,&rdquo; replied Edith. &ldquo;You should hear my club of
      working-girls, who read and think much on these topics, talk of these
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Father Damon, &ldquo;you toss these topics about, and discuss them
      in the magazines, and fancy you are interested in socialistic movements.
      But you have no idea how real and vital they are, and how the dumb
      discontent of the working classes is being formulated into ideas. It is
      time we tried to understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not all the talk was of this sort at the Golden House. There were three
      worlds here&mdash;that of Jack, to which Edith belonged by birth and
      tradition and habit; that of which we have spoken, to which she belonged
      by profound sympathy; and that of Father Damon, to which she belonged by
      undefined aspiration. In him was the spiritual element asserting itself in
      a mediaeval form, in a struggle to mortify and deny the flesh and yet take
      part in modern life. Imagine a celibate and ascetic of the fifteenth
      century, who knew that Paradise must be gained through poverty and
      privation and suffering, interesting himself in the tenement-house
      question, in labor leagues, and the single tax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, hour after hour, in those idle summer days, when nature was in a mood
      that suggested grace and peace, when the waves lapsed along the shore and
      the cicada sang in the hedge, did Father Damon unfold to Edith his ideas
      of the spiritualization of modern life through a conviction of its
      pettiness and transitoriness. How much more content there would be if the
      poor could only believe that it matters little what happens here if the
      heart is only pure and fixed on the endless life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Father Damon,&rdquo; replied Edith, with a grave smile, &ldquo;I think your
      mission ought to be to the rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, for he also knew his world, &ldquo;if I wanted to make my
      ideas fashionable; but I want to make them operative. By-and-by,&rdquo; he
      added, also with a smile, &ldquo;we will organize some fishermen and carpenters
      and tailors on a mission to the rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon&rsquo;s visit was necessarily short, for his work called him back
      to town, and perhaps his conscience smote him a little for indulging in
      this sort of retreat. By the middle of August Jack&rsquo;s yacht was ready, and
      he went with Mavick and the Van Dams and some other men of the club on a
      cruise up the coast. Edith was left alone with her Baltimore friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet not alone. As she lay in her hammock in those dreamy days a new
      world opened to her. It was not described in the chance romance she took
      up, nor in the volume of poems she sometimes held in her hand, with a
      finger inserted in the leaves. Of this world she felt herself the centre
      and the creator, and as she mused upon its mysteries, life took a new,
      strange meaning to her. It was apt to be a little hazy off there in the
      watery horizon, and out of the mist would glide occasionally a boat, and
      the sun would silver its sails, and it would dip and toss for half an hour
      in the blue, laughing sea, and then disappear through the mysterious
      curtain. Whence did it come? Whither had it gone? Was life like that? Was
      she on the shore of such a sea, and was this new world into which she was
      drifting only a dream? By her smile, by the momentary illumination that
      her sweet thoughts made in her lovely, hopeful face, you knew that it was
      not. Who can guess the thoughts of a woman at such a time? Are the trees
      glad in the spring, when the sap leaps in their trunks, and the buds begin
      to swell, and the leaves unfold in soft response to the creative impulse?
      The miracle is never old nor commonplace to them, nor to any of the human
      family. The anticipation of life is eternal. The singing of the birds, the
      blowing of the south wind, the sparkle of the waves, all found a response
      in Edith&rsquo;s heart, which leaped with joy. And yet there was a touch of
      melancholy in it all, the horizon was so vast, and the mist of uncertainty
      lay along it. Literature, society, charities, all that she had read and
      experienced and thought, was nothing to this, this great unknown anxiety
      and bliss, this saddest and sweetest of all human experiences. She prayed
      that she might be worthy of this great distinction, this responsibility
      and blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jack, dear Jack, would he love her more?

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although Father Damon had been absent from his charge only ten days, it
      was time for him to return. If he had not a large personal following, he
      had a wide influence. If comparatively few found their way to his chapel,
      he found his way to many homes; his figure was a familiar one in the
      streets, and his absence was felt by hundreds who had no personal
      relations with him, but who had become accustomed to seeing him go about
      on his errands of encouragement, and probably had never realized how much
      the daily sight of him had touched them. The priestly dress, which may
      once have provoked a sneer at his effeminacy, had now a suggestion of
      refinement, of unselfish devotion, of consecration to the service of the
      unfortunate, his spiritual face appealed to their better natures, and the
      visible heroism that carried his frail figure through labors that would
      have worn out the stoutest physique stirred in the hearts of the rudest
      some comprehension of the reality of the spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not have occurred to them that he was of finer clay than they&mdash;perhaps
      he was not&mdash;but his presence was in their minds a subtle connection
      and not a condescending one, rather a confession of brotherhood, with
      another world and another view of life. They may not have known that their
      hearts were stirred because he had the gift of sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And was it an unmanly trait that he evoked in men that sentiment of
      chivalry which is never wanting in the roughest community for a pure
      woman? Wherever Father Damon went there was respect for his purity and his
      unselfishness, even among those who would have been shamefaced if
      surprised in any exhibition of softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And many loved him, and many depended on him. Perhaps those who most
      depended on him were the least worthy, and those who loved him most were
      least inclined to sacrifice their own reasonable view of life to his own
      sublimated spiritual conception. It was the spirit of the man they loved,
      and not the creed of the priest. The little chapel in its subdued lights
      and shadows, with confessionals and crosses and candles and incense, was
      as restful a refuge as ever to the tired and the dependent; but wanting
      his inspiring face and voice, it was not the same thing, and the
      attendance always fell away when he was absent. There was needed there
      more than elsewhere the living presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was missed, and the little world that missed him was astray. The first
      day of his return his heart was smitten by the thinness of the
      congregation. Had he, then, accomplished nothing; had he made no
      impression, established in his shifting flock no habit of continuance in
      well-doing that could survive even his temporary withdrawal? The fault
      must be his. He had not sufficiently humiliated and consecrated himself,
      and put under all strength of the flesh and trust in worldly
      instrumentalities. There must be more prayer, more vigils, more fasting,
      before the power would come back to him to draw these wandering minds to
      the light. And so in the heat of this exhausting August, at the time when
      his body most needed re-enforcement for the toil he required of it, he was
      more rigid in his spiritual tyranny and contempt of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth Leigh was not dependent upon Father Damon, but she also learned how
      long ten days could be without a sight of him. When she looked into his
      chapel occasionally she realized, as never before, how much in the air his
      ceremonies and his creed were. There was nothing there for her except his
      memory. And she knew when she stepped in there, for her cool, reasoning
      mind was honest, that it was the thought of him that drew her to the
      place, and that going there was a sentimental indulgence. What she would
      have said was that she admired, loved Father Damon on account of his love
      for humanity. It was a common saying of all the professional women in her
      set, and of the working-girls, that they loved Father Damon. It is a
      comfort to women to be able to give their affection freely where
      conventionalities and circumstances make the return of it in degree
      unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of a debilitating day Dr. Leigh found herself in the
      neighborhood of the mission chapel. She was tired and needed to rest
      somewhere. She knew that Father Damon had returned, but she had not seen
      him, and a double motive drew her steps. The attendance was larger than it
      had been recently, and she found a stool in a dark corner, and listened,
      with a weary sort of consciousness of the prayers and the singing, but not
      without a deeper feeling of peace in the tones of a voice every inflection
      of which she knew so well. It seemed to her that the reading cost him an
      effort, and there was a note of pathos in the voice that thrilled her.
      Presently he advanced towards the altar rail&mdash;he was accustomed to do
      this with his little flock&mdash;and placing one hand on the lectern,
      began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, and this was not usual, he spoke about himself in a strain of
      sincere humility, taking blame upon himself for his inability to do
      effectively the great service his Master had set him to do. He meant to
      have given himself more entirely to the dear people among whom he labored;
      he hoped to show himself more worthy of the trust they had given him; he
      was grateful for the success of his mission, but no one knew so well as he
      how far short it came of being what he ought to have made it. He knew
      indeed how weak he was, and he asked the aid of their sympathy and
      encouragement. It seemed to be with difficulty that he said this, and to
      Ruth&rsquo;s sympathetic ear there was an evidence of physical exhaustion in his
      tone. There was in it, also, for her, a confession of failure, the cry of
      the preacher, in sorrow and entreaty, that says, &ldquo;I have called so long,
      and ye would not listen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he went on, still with an effort and feebly, there came over the little
      group a feeling of awe and wonderment, and the silence was profound. Still
      steadying himself by the reading-desk, he went on to speak of other
      things, of those of his followers who listened, of the great mass swirling
      about them in the streets who did not listen and did not care; of the
      little life that now is so full of pain and hardship and disappointment,
      of good intentions frustrated, of hopes that deceive, and of fair
      prospects that turn to ashes, of good lives that go wrong, of sweet
      natures turned to bitterness in the unaided struggle. His voice grew
      stronger and clearer, as his body responded to the kindling theme in his
      soul. He stepped away from the desk nearer the rail, the bowed head was
      raised. &ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is only for a little while, my
      children.&rdquo; Those who heard him that day say that his face shone like that
      of an angel, and that his voice was like a victorious clarion, so clear,
      so sweet, so inspiring, as he spoke of the life that is to come, and the
      fair certainty of that City where he with them all wished to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he closed, some were kneeling, many were crying; all, profoundly moved,
      watched him as, with the benediction and the sign of the cross, he turned
      and walked swiftly to the door of the sacristy. It opened, and then Ruth
      Leigh heard a cry, &ldquo;Father Damon! Father Damon!&rdquo; and there was a rush into
      the chancel. Hastening through the throng, which promptly made way for the
      doctor, she found Father Damon lying across the threshold, as he had
      fallen, colorless and unconscious. She at once took command of the
      situation. The body was lifted to the plain couch in the room, a hasty
      examination was made of pulse and heart, a vial of brandy was produced
      from her satchel, and messengers were despatched for things needed, and
      especially for beef-tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead, Dr. Leigh? Is he any better, doctor? What is the matter,
      doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want of nourishment,&rdquo; replied Dr. Leigh, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was cleared of all except a couple of stout lads and a friendly
      German woman whom the doctor knew. The news of the father&rsquo;s sudden illness
      had spread rapidly, with the report that he had fallen dead while standing
      at the altar; and the church was thronged, and the street rapidly blocked
      up with a hushed crowd, eager for news and eager to give aid. So great was
      the press that the police had to interfere, and push back the throng from
      the door. It was useless to attempt to disperse it with the assurance that
      Father Damon was better; it patiently waited to see for itself. The
      sympathy of the neighborhood was most impressive, and perhaps the thing
      that the public best remembers about this incident is the pathetic
      solicitude of the people among whom Father Damon labored at the rumor of
      his illness, a matter which was greatly elaborated by the reporters from
      the city journals and the purveyors of telegraphic news for the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the application of restoratives the patient revived. When he opened
      his eyes he saw figures in the room as in a dream, and his mind struggled
      to remember where he was and what had happened; but one thing was not a
      dream: Dr. Leigh stood by his bedside, with her left hand on his brow and
      the right grasping his own right hand, as if to pull him back to life. He
      saw her face, and then he lost it again in sheer weariness at the effort.
      After a few moments, in a recurring wave of strength, he looked up again,
      still bewildered, and said, faintly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With friends,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You were a little faint, that is all;
      you will be all right presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She quickly prepared some nourishment, which was what he most needed, and
      fed him from time to time, as he was able to receive it. Gradually he
      could feel a little vigor coming into his frame; and regaining control of
      himself, he was able to hear what had happened. Very gently the doctor
      told him, making light of his temporary weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Father Damon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got a disease common in
      this neighborhood&mdash;hunger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father smiled, but did not reply. It might be so. For the time he felt
      his dependence, and he did not argue the point. This dependence upon a
      woman&mdash;a sort of Sister of Charity, was she not?&mdash;was not
      altogether unpleasant. When he attempted to rise, but found that he was
      too weak, and she said &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; he submitted, with the feeling that to
      be commanded with such gentleness was a sort of luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in an hour&rsquo;s time he declared that he was almost himself again, and it
      was decided that he was well enough to be removed to his own apartments in
      the neighborhood. A carriage was sent for, and the transfer was made, and
      made through a crowd in the streets, which stood silent and uncovered as
      his carriage passed through it. Dr. Leigh remained with him for an hour
      longer, and then left him in charge of a young gentleman from the
      Neighborhood Guild, who gladly volunteered to watch for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth walked slowly home, weary now that the excitement was over, and
      revolving many things in her mind, as is the custom of women. She heard
      again that voice, she saw again that inspired face; but the impression
      most indelible with her was the prostrate form, the pallid countenance,
      the helplessness of this man whose will had before been strong enough to
      compel the obedience of his despised body. She had admired his strength;
      but it was his weakness that drew upon her woman&rsquo;s heart, and evolved a
      tenderness dangerous to her peace of mind. Yet it was the doctor and not
      the woman that replied to the inquiries at the dispensary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was fasting and overwork. Men are so stupid; they think they can
      defy all the laws of nature, especially priests.&rdquo; And she determined to be
      quite plain with him next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Father Damon, lying weary in his bed, before he fell asleep, saw the
      faces in the dim chapel turned to him in strained eagerness the moment
      before he lost consciousness; but the most vivid image was that of a woman
      bending over him, with eyes of tenderness and pity, and the smile with
      which she greeted his awakening. He could feel yet her hand upon his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Leigh called next day, on her morning rounds, she found a brother
      of the celibate order, Father Monies, in charge. He was sitting by the
      window reading, and when the doctor came up the steps he told her in a low
      voice to enter without knocking. Father Damon was better, much better; but
      he had advised him not to leave his bed, and the patient had been dozing
      all the morning. The doctor asked if he had eaten anything, and how much.
      The apartment was small and scantily furnished&mdash;a sort of anchorite
      cell. Through the drawn doors of the next room the bed was in sight. As
      they were talking in low voices there came from this room a cheerful:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you ate a good breakfast,&rdquo; she said, as she arose and went to his
      bedside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean better than usual,&rdquo; he replied, with a faint attempt
      at a smile. &ldquo;No doubt you and Father Monies are satisfied, now you&rsquo;ve got
      me laid up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon your intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I intend to get up tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do, without other change in your intentions, I am going to report
      you to the Organized Charity as a person who has no visible means of
      support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had brought a bunch of violets, and as they talked she had filled a
      glass with water and put them on a stand by the head of the bed. Then&mdash;oh,
      quite professionally&mdash;she smoothed out his pillows and straightened
      the bedclothes, and, talking all the time, and as if quite unconscious of
      what she was doing, moved about the room, putting things to rights, and
      saying, in answer to his protest, that perhaps she should lose her
      reputation as a physician in his eyes by appearing to be a professional
      nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a timid knock at the door, and a forlorn little figure, clad in
      a rumpled calico, with an old shawl over her head, half concealing an
      eager and pretty face, stood in the doorway, and hesitatingly came in.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Meine Mutter sent me to see how Father Damon is,&rdquo; she explained; &ldquo;she
      could not come, because she washes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a bunch of flowers in her hand, and encouraged by the greeting of
      the invalid, she came to the bedside and placed them in his outstretched
      hand&mdash;a faded blossom of scarlet geranium, a bachelor&rsquo;s button, and a
      sprig of parsley, probably begged of a street dealer as she came along.
      &ldquo;Some blooms,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, my dear,&rdquo; said Father Damon; &ldquo;they are very pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey smells nice,&rdquo; the child exclaimed, her eyes dancing with pleasure at
      the reception of her gift. She stood staring at him, and then, her eye
      catching the violets, she added, &ldquo;Dose is pooty, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can stay half an hour or so, I should like to step round to the
      chapel,&rdquo; Father Monies said to the doctor in the front room, taking up his
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor could stay. The little girl had moved a chair up to the
      bedside, and sat quite silent, her grimy little hand grasped in the
      father&rsquo;s. Ruth, saying that she hoped the father wouldn&rsquo;t mind, began to
      put in order the front room, which the incidents of the night had somewhat
      disturbed. Father Damon, holding fast by that little hand to the world of
      poverty to which he had devoted his life, could not refrain from watching
      her, as she moved about with the quick, noiseless way that a woman has
      when she is putting things to rights. This was indeed a novel invasion of
      his life. He was still too weak to reason about it much. How good she was,
      how womanly! And what a sense of peace and repose she brought into his
      apartment! The presence of Brother Monies was peaceful also, but hers was
      somehow different. His eyes had not cared to follow the brother about the
      room. He knew that she was unselfish, but he had not noticed before that
      her ways were so graceful. As she turned her face towards him from time to
      time he thought its expression beautiful. Ruth Leigh would have smiled
      grimly if any one had called her beautiful, but then she did not know how
      she looked sometimes when her feelings were touched. It is said that the
      lamp of love can illumine into beauty any features of clay through which
      it shines. As he gazed, letting himself drift as in a dream, suddenly a
      thought shot through his mind that made him close his eyes, and such a
      severe priestly look came upon his face that the little girl, who had
      never taken her eyes off him, exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear,&rdquo; he replied, with a reassuring smile; &ldquo;at least, I hope
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the doctor, finishing her work, drew a chair into the doorway,
      and sat by the foot of his bed, the stern look still remained on his pale
      face. And the doctor, she also was the doctor again, as matter of fact as
      in any professional visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a shade of impatience on her face as she replied, &ldquo;But you must
      be a little kind to yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it does matter. You defeat the very work you want to do. I&rsquo;m going to
      report you to your order.&rdquo; And then she added, more lightly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      know it is wrong to commit suicide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There is more than one kind of
      suicide; you don&rsquo;t believe in the suicide of the soul. Ah, me!&rdquo; And a
      shade of pain passed over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quick to see this. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Father Damon. It is none of
      my business, but we are all so anxious to have you speedily well again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Father Monies returned, and the doctor rose to go. She took the
      little girl by the hand and said, &ldquo;Come, I was just going round to see
      your father. Good-by. I shall look in again tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;thank you a thousand times. But you have so much to do
      that you must not bother about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether he said this to quiet his own conscience, secretly hoping that he
      might see her again on the morrow, perhaps he himself could not have
      decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late the next afternoon, after an unusually weary round of visits, made in
      the extreme heat and in a sort of hopeless faithfulness, Dr. Leigh reached
      the tenement in which Father Damon lodged: In all the miserable scenes of
      the day it had been in her mind, giving to her work a pleasure that she
      did not openly acknowledge even to herself, that she should see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains were down, and there was no response to her knock, except
      from a door in the passage opposite. A woman opened the door wide enough
      to show her head and to make it evident that she was not sufficiently
      dressed to come out, and said that Father Damon had gone. He was very much
      better, and his friend had taken him up-town. Dr. Leigh thanked her, and
      said she was very glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so glad that, as she walked away, scarcely heeding her steps or
      conscious of the chaffing, chattering crowd, all interest in her work and
      in that quarter of the city seemed dead.

      It is well that there is pleasure somewhere in the world. It is possible
      for those who have a fresh-air fund of their own to steam away in a yacht,
      out of the midsummer ennui and the weary gayety of the land. It is a
      costly pleasure, and probably all the more enjoyed on that account, for if
      everybody had a yacht there would be no more feeling of distinction in
      sailing one than in going to any of the second-rate resorts on the coast.
      There is, to be sure, some ennui in yachting on a rainy coast, and it
      might be dull but for the sensation created by arrivals at watering-places
      and the telegraphic reports of these sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was any dullness on the Delancy yacht, means were taken to dispel
      it. While still in the Sound a society was formed for the suppression of
      total abstinence, and so successful was this that Point Judith was passed,
      in a rain and a high and chopping sea, with a kind of hilarious enjoyment
      of the commotion, which is one of the things desired at sea. When the
      party came round to Newport it declared that it had had a lovely voyage,
      and inquiry brought out the great general principle, applicable to most
      coast navigation for pleasure, that the enjoyable way to pass Point Judith
      is not to know you are passing Point Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except when you land, and even after you have got your sea-legs on, there
      is a certain monotony in yachting, unless the weather is very bad, and
      unless there are women aboard. A party of lively women make even the sea
      fresh and entertaining. Otherwise, the game of poker is much what it is on
      land, and the constant consulting of charts and reckoning of speed evince
      the general desire to get somewhere&mdash;that is, to arrive at a harbor.
      In the recollections of this voyage, even in Jack&rsquo;s recollections of it
      after he had paid the bills, it seemed that it had been simply glorious,
      free from care, generally a physical setting-up performance, and a lark of
      enormous magnitude. And everybody envied the fortunate sailors.

    <p>
      Mavick actually did enjoy it, for he had that brooding sort of nature,
      that self-satisfied attitude, that is able to appropriate to its own uses
      whatever comes. And being an unemotional and very tolerable sailor, he was
      able to be as cynical at sea as on land, and as much of an oracle, in his
      wholly unobtrusive way. The perfect personal poise of Mavick, which gave
      him an air of patronizing the ocean, and his lightly held skeptical view
      of life, made his company as full of flavor on ship as it was on shore. He
      didn&rsquo;t know anything more about the weather than the Weather Bureau knows,
      yet the helmsman of the yacht used to consult him about the appearances of
      the sky and a change of wind with a confidence in his opinion that he gave
      to no one else on board. And Mavick never forfeited this respect by being
      too positive. It was so with everything; he evidently knew a great deal
      more than he cared to tell. It is pleasing to notice how much credit such
      men as Mavick obtain in the world by circumspect reticence and a knowing
      manner. Jack, blundering along in his free-hearted, emotional way, and
      never concealing his opinion, was really right twice where Mavick was
      right once, but he never had the least credit for wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in August that the Delancy yacht steamed into the splendid Bar
      Harbor, making its way slowly through one of the rare fogs which are
      sometimes seen by people who do not own real estate there. Even before
      they could see an island those on board felt the combination of mountain
      and sea air that makes this favored place at once a tonic and a sedative
      to the fashionable world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party were expected at Bar Harbor. It had been announced that the
      yacht was on its way, and some of the projected gayeties were awaiting its
      coming, for the society reenforcement of the half-dozen men on board was
      not to be despised. The news went speedily round that Captain Delancy&rsquo;s
      flag was flying at the anchorage off the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the first to welcome them as they landed and strolled up to the
      hotel was Major Fairfax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;we are all here&mdash;that is, all who know where they
      ought to be at the right moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the new-comers the scene was animated. The exotic shops sparkled with
      cheap specialties; landaus, pony-phaetons, and elaborate buckboards dashed
      through the streets; aquatic and law-tennis costumes abounded. If there
      was not much rowing and lawn-tennis, there was a great deal of becoming
      morning dressing for these sports, and in all the rather aimless idleness
      there was an air of determined enjoyment. Even here it was evident that
      there was a surplus of women. These lovers of nature, in the summer
      season, who had retired to this wild place to be free from the
      importunities of society, betrayed, Mavick thought, the common instinct of
      curiosity over the new arrival, and he was glad to take it as an evidence
      that they loved not nature less but man more. Jack tripped up this
      ungallant speech by remarking that if Mavick was in this mood he did not
      know why he came ashore. And Van Dam said that sooner or later all men
      went ashore. This thin sort of talk was perhaps pardonable after the
      weariness of a sea voyage, but the Major promptly said it wouldn&rsquo;t do. And
      the Major seemed to be in charge of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No epigrams are permitted. We are here to enjoy ourselves. I&rsquo;m ordered to
      bring the whole crew of you to tea at the Tavish cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody else there?&rdquo; asked Jack, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the most curious coincidence, but Mrs. Henderson arrived last
      night; Henderson has gone to Missouri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he wrote me to look out for his wife on this coast,&rdquo; said Mavick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You kept mighty still about it,&rdquo; said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did you,&rdquo; retorted Mavick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very curious,&rdquo; the Major explained, &ldquo;how fashionable intelligence
      runs along this coast, apparently independent of the telegraph; everybody
      knows where everybody else is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Tavish cottage was a summer palace of the present fashion, but there
      was one good thing about it: it had no tower, nor any make-believe
      balconies hung on the outside like bird-cages. The rooms were spacious,
      and had big fireplaces, and ample piazzas all round, so that the sun could
      be courted or the wind be avoided at all hours of the day. It was, in
      short, not a house for retirement and privacy, but for entertainment. It
      was furnished luxuriously but gayly, and with its rugs and portieres and
      divans it reminded Mavick of an Oriental marquee. Miss Tavish called it
      her tepee, an evolution of the aboriginal dwelling. She liked to
      entertain, and she never appeared to better advantage than when her house
      was full, and something was going on continually-lively breakfasts and
      dinners, dances, theatricals, or the usual flowing in and out of callers
      and guests, chattering groups, and flirtatious couples. It was her idea of
      repose from the winter&rsquo;s gayety, and in it she sustained the role of the
      non-fatigueable society girl. It is a performance that many working-girls
      regard with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was quite a flutter in the cottage, as there always is when those
      who know each other well meet under new circumstances after a short
      separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are very glad to see you,&rdquo; Miss Tavish said, cordially; &ldquo;we have been
      awfully dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is complimentary to me,&rdquo; said the Major.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0213}.jpg" alt="{0213}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0213}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;You can judge the depths we have been in when even the Major couldn&rsquo;t
      pull us out,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;Without him we should have simply died.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it would have been the liveliest obsequies I ever attended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen was not effusive in her greeting; she left that role to Miss
      Tavish, taking for herself that of confidential friend. She was almost
      retiring in her manner, but she made Jack feel that she had a strong
      personal interest in his welfare, and she asked a hundred questions about
      the voyage and about town and about Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to chaperon you up here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for Miss Tavish will lead
      you into all sorts of wild adventures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was that in the manner of the demure little woman when she made this
      proposal that convinced Jack that under her care he would be perfectly
      safe&mdash;from Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      After cigarettes were lighted she contrived to draw Mavick away to the
      piazza. She was very anxious to know what Henderson&rsquo;s latest moves were.
      Mavick was very communicative, and told her nothing that he knew she did
      not already know. And she was clever enough to see, without any apparent
      distrust, that whatever she got from him must be in what he did not say.
      As to Jack&rsquo;s speculations, she made little more progress. Jack gave every
      sign of being prosperous; he entertained royally on his yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mavick himself was puzzled to know whether Carmen really cared for Jack,
      or whether she was only interested as in a game, one of the things that
      amused her life to play, to see how far he would go, and to watch his
      ascension or his tumble. Mavick would have been surprised if he had known
      that as a result of this wholly agreeable and confidential talk, Carmen
      wrote that night in a letter to her husband:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friend Mavick is here. What a very clever man he is! If I were you I
      would keep an eye on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dozen plans were started at the tea for relieving the tedium of the
      daily drives and the regulation teas and receptions. For one thing,
      weather permitting, they would all breakfast at twelve on the yacht, and
      then sail about the harbor, and come home in the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was indeed charming, so stimulating as to raise the value of real
      estate, and incite everybody to go off in search of adventure, in wagons,
      in walking parties, in boats. There is no happiness like the anticipation
      of pleasure begot by such a morning. Those who live there said it was
      regular Bar Harbor weather.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0217}.jpg" alt="{0217}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0217}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Captain Delancy was on deck to receive his guests, who came out in small
      boats, chattering and fluttering and &ldquo;ship-ahoying,&rdquo; as gay in spirits as
      in apparel. Anything but high spirits and nonsense would be unpardonable
      on such a morning. Breakfast was served on deck, under an awning, in sight
      of the mountains, the green islands, the fringe of breaking sea in the
      distant opening, the shimmer and sparkle of the harbor, the white sails of
      pleasure-boats, the painted canoes, the schooners and coal-boats and
      steamers swinging at anchor just enough to make all the scene alive. &ldquo;This
      is my idea,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;of going to sea in a yacht; it would be
      perfect if we were tied up at the dock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move that we throw the Major overboard,&rdquo; cried Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Jack exclaimed; &ldquo;it is against the law to throw anything into the
      harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I expected Miss Tavish would throw me overboard when Mavick
      appeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mavick raised his glass and proposed the health of Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; the Major said; &ldquo;my life is passed in returning good
      for evil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knew before,&rdquo; and Miss Tavish bowed her acknowledgments, &ldquo;the
      secret of the Major&rsquo;s attractions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Carmen, sweetly, &ldquo;he is all things to all women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t appear to have a friend here, Major,&rdquo; Mavick suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; my friends are all foul-weather friends; come a bright day, they are
      all off like butterflies. That comes of being constant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no distinction,&rdquo; Carmen exclaimed; &ldquo;all men are that till they get
      what they want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! that women also in these days here become cynical! It was not so
      when I was young. Here&rsquo;s to the ever young,&rdquo; and he bowed to Carmen and
      Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been with Ponce de Leon!&rdquo; cried Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the dearest man living, except a few,&rdquo; echoed Carmen. &ldquo;The Major&rsquo;s
      health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yellow wine sparkled in the glasses like the sparkling sea, the wind
      blew softly from the south, the sails in the bay darkened and flashed, and
      the breakfast, it seemed to go along of itself, and erelong the convives
      were eating ambrosia and sipping nectar. Van Dam told a shark story.
      Mavick demonstrated its innate improbability. The Major sang a song&mdash;a
      song of the forties, with a touch of sentiment. Jack, whose cheerful voice
      was a little of the cider-cellar order, and who never sang when he was
      sad, struck up the latest vaudeville ditty, and Carmen and Miss Tavish
      joined in the chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the sea,&rdquo; the Major declared. They all liked it. The breakfast
      lasted a long time, and when they rose from the table Jack said that
      presently they would take a course round the harbor. The Major remarked
      that that would suit him. He appeared to be ready to go round the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were preparing to start, Carmen and Jack strolled away to the
      bow, where she perched herself, holding on by the rigging. He thought he
      had never seen her look so pretty as at that moment, in her trim nautical
      costume, sitting up there, swinging her feet like a girl, and regarding
      him with half-mocking, half-admiring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were they saying? Heaven only knows. What nonsense do people so
      situated usually talk? Perhaps she was warning him against Miss Tavish.
      Perhaps she was protesting that Julia Tavish was a very, very old friend.
      To an observer this admirable woman seemed to be on the defensive&mdash;her
      most alluring attitude. It was not, one could hear, exactly sober talk;
      there was laughter and raillery and earnestness mingled. It might be said
      that they were good comrades. Carmen professed to like good comradeship
      and no nonsense. But she liked to be confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till late in the afternoon they cruised about among the islands, getting
      different points of view of the coast, and especially different points of
      view of each other, in the freedom of talk and repartee permitted on an
      excursion. Before sunset they were out in the open, and could feel the
      long ocean swell. The wind had risen a little, and there was a low band of
      clouds in the south. The skipper told Mr. Delancy that it would be much
      fresher with the sinking of the sun, but Jack replied that it wouldn&rsquo;t
      amount to anything; the glass was all right.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Now the great winds shoreward blow;
        Now the salt tides seaward flow;
        Now the wild white horses play,
        Champ and chafe and toss in the spray.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Miss Tavish was in the wheel-house, and had taken the wheel. This clever
      girl knew her right hand from her left, instantly, without having to stop
      and think and look at her rings, and she knew what port and starboard
      meant, as orders, and exactly how to meet a wave with a turn of the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Captain Delancy,&rdquo; she cried out, &ldquo;the steamer is about due. Let&rsquo;s
      go down and meet her, and race in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;We can run round her three times and then beat
      her in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steamer&rsquo;s smoke was seen at that instant, and the yacht was headed for
      it. The wind was a little fresher, but the tight little craft took the
      waves like a duck, and all on board enjoyed the excitement of the change,
      except the Major, who said he didn&rsquo;t mind, but he didn&rsquo;t believe the
      steamer needed any escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the steamer was reached the sun was going down in a band of
      clouds. There was no gale, but the wind increased in occasional puffs of
      spite, and the waves were getting up. The skipper took the wheel to turn
      the yacht in a circle to her homeward course. As this operation created
      strange motions, and did not interest the Major, he said he would go below
      and reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In turning, the yacht came round on the seaward side of the steamer, but
      far behind. But the little craft speedily showed her breeding and
      overhauled her big rival, and began to forge ahead. The little group on
      the yacht waved their handkerchiefs as if in good-by, and the passengers
      on the steamer cheered. As the wind was every moment increasing, the
      skipper sheered away to allow plenty of sea-room between the boats. The
      race appeared to be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said Miss Tavish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go round her,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;eh, skipper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like, sir,&rdquo; responded the skipper. &ldquo;She can do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The yacht was well ahead, but the change in the direction brought the
      vessels nearer together. But there was no danger. The speed they were
      going would easily bring her round away ahead of the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just then something happened. The yacht would not answer to her helm.
      The wheel flew around without resistance. The wind, hauled now into the
      east, struck her with violence and drove her sideways. The little thing
      was like a chip on the sea. The rudder-chain had broken. The yacht seemed
      to fly towards the long, hulking steamer. The danger was seen there, and
      her helm was put hard down, and her nose began to turn towards the shore.
      But it was too late. It seemed all over in an instant. The yacht dashed
      bow on to the side of the steamer, quivered an instant, and then dropped
      away. At the same moment the steamer slowed down and began to turn to
      assist the wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The skipper of the yacht and a couple of hands rushed below. A part of the
      bow had been carried away and a small hole made just above the waterline,
      through which the water spurted whenever she encountered a large wave. It
      was enough to waterlog her and sink her in such a sea. The two seamen
      grasped whatever bedding was in reach below, rammed it into the opening,
      and held it there. The skipper ran on deck, and by the aid of the men
      hauled out a couple of sails and dropped them over the bow. These would
      aid in keeping out the water. They could float now, but where were they
      going? &ldquo;Going ashore,&rdquo; said Mavick, grimly. And so they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a panic on board?&rdquo; it was asked afterwards. Not exactly. Among
      well-bred people a panic is never good form. But there were white faces
      and trembling knees and anxious looks. The steamer was coming towards
      them, and all eyes were fixed on that rather than on the rocks of the
      still distant shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most striking incident of the moment&mdash;it seemed so to some of
      those who looked back upon it&mdash;was a singular test of character, or
      rather of woman&rsquo;s divination of character. Carmen instinctively flew to
      Jack and grasped and held his arm. She knew, without stopping to reason
      about it, that he would unhesitatingly imperil his life to save that of
      any woman. Whatever judgment is passed upon Jack, this should not be
      forgotten. And Miss Tavish; to whom did she fly in this peril? To the
      gallant Major? No. To the cool and imperturbable Mavick, who was as strong
      and sinewy as he was cool? No. She ran without hesitation to Van Dam, and
      clung to him, recognizing instinctively, with the woman&rsquo;s feeling, the
      same quality that Jack had. There are such men, who may have no great
      gifts, but who will always fight rather than run under fire, and who will
      always protect a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mavick saw all this, and understood it perfectly, and didn&rsquo;t object to it
      at the time&mdash;but he did not forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of rescue was not easy in that sea and wind, but it was
      dexterously done. The steamer approached and kept at a certain distance on
      the windward side. A boat was lowered, and a line was brought to the
      yacht, which was soon in tow with a stout cable hitched to the steamer&rsquo;s
      anchor windlass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all done with much less excitement than appeared from the
      telegraphic accounts, and while the party were being towed home the peril
      seemed to have been exaggerated, and the affair to look like an ordinary
      sea incident. But the skipper said that it was one escape in a hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the steamer raised his hat gravely in reply to the little
      cheer from the yacht, when Carmen and Miss Tavish fluttered their
      handkerchiefs towards him. The only chaff from the steamer was roared out
      by a fat Boston man, who made a funnel of his hands and shouted, &ldquo;The race
      is not always to the swift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Jack stepped ashore he telegraphed to Edith that the yacht had
      had an accident in the harbor, but that no one was hurt. When he reached
      the hotel he found a letter from Edith of such a tenor that he sent
      another despatch, saying that she might expect him at once, leaving the
      yacht behind. There was a buzz of excitement in the town, and there were a
      hundred rumors, which the sight of the yacht and its passengers landed in
      safety scarcely sufficed to allay.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jack called at the Tavish cottage to say good-by, both the ladies
      were too upset to see him. He took a night train, and as he was whirled
      away in the darkness the events of the preceding forty-eight hours seemed
      like a dream. Even the voyage up the coast was a little unreal&mdash;an
      insubstantial episode in life. And the summer city by the sea, with its
      gayety and gossip and busy idleness, sank out of sight like a phantom. He
      drew his cap over his eyes, and was impatient that the rattling train did
      not go faster, for Edith, waiting there in the Golden House, seemed to
      stretch out her arms for him to come. Still behind him rose a picture of
      that bacchanalian breakfast&mdash;the Major and Carmen and Mavick and Miss
      Tavish dancing a reel on the sloping deck, then the rising wind, the
      reckless daring of the race, and a vision of sudden death. He shuddered
      for the first time in a quick realization of how nearly it came to being
      all over with life and its pleasures.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Edith had made no appeal to Jack to come home. His going, therefore, had
      the merit in his eyes of being a voluntary response to the promptings of
      his better nature. Perhaps but for the accident at Mount Desert he might
      have felt that his summer pleasure was needlessly interfered with, but the
      little shock of that was a real, if still temporary, moral turning-point
      for him. For the moment his inclination seemed to run with his duty, and
      he had his reward in Edith&rsquo;s happiness at his coming, the loving hunger in
      her eyes, the sweet trust that animated her face, the delightful
      appropriation of him that could scarcely brook a moment&rsquo;s absence from her
      sight. There could not be a stronger appeal to his manhood and his
      fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jack dear, it was a little lonesome.&rdquo; She was swinging in her
      hammock on the veranda in sight of the sea, and Jack sat by her with his
      cigar. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you now that there were times when I longed
      for you dreadfully, but I was glad, all the same, that you were enjoying
      yourself, for it is tiresome down here for a man with nothing to do but to
      wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear thing!&rdquo; said Jack, with his hand on her head, smoothing her
      glossy hair and pushing it back from her forehead, to make her look more
      intellectual&mdash;a thing which she hated. &ldquo;Yes, dear, I was a brute to
      go off at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wanted to comeback?&rdquo; And there was a wistful look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I did,&rdquo; he answered, fervently, as he leaned over the hammock to
      kiss the sweet eyes into content; and he was quite honest in the
      expression of a desire that was nearly forty-eight hours old, and by a
      singular mental reaction seemed to have been always present with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so good of you to telegraph me before I could see the newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I knew the account would be greatly exaggerated;&rdquo; and he made
      light of the whole affair, knowing that the facts would still be capable
      of shocking her, giving a comic picture of the Major&rsquo;s seafaring
      qualities, and Carmen&rsquo;s and Miss Tavish&rsquo;s chaff of the gallant old beau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with this light sketching of the event she could not avoid a
      retrospective pang of apprehension, and the tightened grasp of his hand
      was as if she were holding him fast from that and all other peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days went by in content, on the whole, shaded a little by anxiety and
      made grave by a new interest. It could not well be but that the prospect
      of the near future, with its increase of responsibility, should create a
      little uneasiness in Jack&rsquo;s mind as to his own career. Of this future they
      talked much, and in Jack&rsquo;s attitude towards her Edith saw, for the first
      time since her marriage, a lever of suggestion, and it came naturally in
      the contemplation of their future life that she should encourage his
      discontent at having no occupation. Facing, in this waiting-time of quiet,
      certain responsibilities, it was impressed upon him that the collecting of
      bric-a-brac was scarcely an occupation, and that idling in clubs and
      studios and dangling about at the beck of society women was scarcely a
      career that could save him from ultimate ennui. To be sure, he had plenty
      of comrades, young fellows of fortune, who never intended to do anything
      except to use it for their personal satisfaction; but they did not seem to
      be of much account except in the little circle that they ornamented.
      Speaking of one of them one day, Father Damon had said that it seemed a
      pity a fellow of such family and capacity and fortune should go to the
      devil merely for the lack of an object in life. In this closer communion
      with Edith, whose ideas he began to comprehend, Jack dimly apprehended
      this view, and for the moment impulsively accepted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m half sorry,&rdquo; he said one day, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t go in for a profession.
      But it is late now. Law, medicine, engineering, architecture, would take
      years of study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was Armstrong,&rdquo; Edith suggested, &ldquo;who studied law after he was
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it looks sort of silly for a fellow who has a wife to go to school,
      unless,&rdquo; said Jack, with a laugh, &ldquo;he goes to school to his wife. Then
      there&rsquo;s politics. You wouldn&rsquo;t like to see me in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think, Jack&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke musingly&mdash;&ldquo;if I were a man I
      should go into politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have nice company!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the noblest career&mdash;government, legislation, trying to do
      something to make the world better. Jack, I don&rsquo;t see how the men of New
      York can stand it to be governed by the very worst elements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, you have no idea what practical politics is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea what I&rsquo;d make it. What is the good of young men of leisure
      if they don&rsquo;t do anything for the country? Too fine to do what Hamilton
      did and Jay did! I wish you could have heard my father talk about it.
      Abdicate their birthright for a four-in-hand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a yacht,&rdquo; suggested Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why a man cannot own a yacht and still care something
      about the decent management of his city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mavick in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. Mavick is in office for what he can make. No, I will not say
      that. No doubt he is a good civil servant, and we can&rsquo;t expect everybody
      to be unselfish. At any rate, he is intelligent. Do you remember what Mr.
      Morgan said last winter?&rdquo; And Edith lifted herself up on her elbow, as if
      to add the weight of her attitude to her words, as Jack was still smiling
      at her earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you said he was a delightful sort of pessimist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morgan said that the trouble with the governing and legislation now
      in the United States is that everybody is superficially educated, and that
      the people are putting their superficial knowledge into laws, and that we
      are going to have a nice time with all these wild theories and crudities
      on the statute-book. And then educated people say that politics is so
      corrupt and absurd that they cannot have anything to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how far do you think we could get, my dear, in the crusade you
      propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that you would get anywhere. Yet I should think the young
      men of New York could organize its intelligence and do something. But you
      think I&rsquo;m nothing but a woman.&rdquo; And Edith sank back, as if abandoning the
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought that; but it is hard to tell, these days. Never mind, when
      we go back to town I&rsquo;ll stir round; you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an unusual sort of talk. Jack had never heard Edith break out in
      this direction before, and he wondered if many women were beginning to
      think of men in this way, as cowardly about their public duties. Not many
      in his set, he was sure. If Edith had urged him to go into Neighborhood
      Guild work, he could have understood that. Women and ethical cranks were
      interested in that. And women were getting queerer every day, beginning,
      as Mavick said, to take notice. However, it was odd, when you thought over
      it, that the city should be ruled by the slums.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy to talk about these things; in fact, Jack talked a great deal
      about them in the clubs, and occasionally with a knot of men after dinner
      in a knowing, pessimistic sort of way. Sometimes the discussions were very
      animated and even noisy between these young citizens. It seemed,
      sometimes, about midnight, that something might be done; but the
      resolution vanished next morning when another day, to be lived through,
      confronted them. They illustrated the great philosophic observation that
      it is practically impossible for an idle man who has nothing to do to
      begin anything today.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do Jack justice, this enforced detention in the country he did not find
      dull exactly. To be sure it was vacation-time, and his whole life was a
      vacation, and summer was rather more difficult to dispose of than winter,
      for one had to make more of an effort to amuse himself. But Edith was
      never more charming than in this new dependence, and all his love and
      loyalty were evoked in caring for her. This was occupation enough, even if
      he had been the busiest man in the world-to watch over her, to read to
      her, to anticipate her fancies, to live with her in that dream of the
      future which made life seem almost ideal. There came a time when he looked
      back upon this month at the Golden House as the happiest in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk about an occupation was not again referred to. Edith seemed
      entirely happy to have Jack with her, more entirely her own than he had
      ever been, and to have him just as he was. And yet he knew, by a sure
      instinct, that she saw him as she thought he would be, with some aim and
      purpose in life. And he made many good resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      That which was nearest him attracted him most, and very feeble now were
      the allurements of the life and the company he had just left. Not that he
      would break with it exactly; it was not necessary to do that; but he would
      find something to do, something worth a man&rsquo;s doing, or, at any rate, some
      occupation that should tax his time and his energies. That, he knew, would
      make Edith happy, and to make her happy seemed now very much like a worthy
      object in life. She was so magnanimous, so unsuspicious, so full of all
      nobility. He knew she would stand by him whatever happened. Down here her
      attitude to life was no longer a rebuke to him nor a restraint upon him.
      Everything seemed natural and wholesome. Perhaps his vanity was touched,
      for there must be something in, him if such a woman could love him. And
      probably there was, though he himself had never yet had a chance to find
      it out. Brought up in the expectation of a fortune, bred to idleness as
      others are to industry, his highest ambition having been to amuse himself
      creditably and to take life easily, what was to hinder his being one of
      the multitude of &ldquo;good-for-nothings&rdquo; in our modern life? If there had been
      war, he had spirit enough to carry him into it, and it would have
      surprised no one to hear that Jack had joined an exploring expedition to
      the North Pole or the highlands of Central Asia. Something uncommon he
      might do if opportunity offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      About his operations with Henderson he had never told Edith, and he did
      not tell her now. Perhaps she divined it, and he rather wondered that she
      had never asked him about his increased expenditures, his yacht, and all
      that. He used to look at her steadily at times, as if he were trying to
      read the secrets of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking at, Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see if I can find out how much you know, you look so wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I? I was just thinking about you. I suppose that made me look so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; about life and the world generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty little, Jack, except&mdash;well, I study you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? Then you&rsquo;ll presently lose your mind:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack and most men have little idea that they are windows through which
      their wives see the world; and how much more of the world they know in
      that way than men usually suspect or wives ever tell!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not tell her about Henderson, but he almost resolved that when his
      present venture was over he would let stocks alone as speculations, and go
      into something that he could talk about to his wife as he talked about
      stocks to Carmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the stranded mariners at Bar Harbor Captain Jack had many and
      facetious letters. They wanted to know if his idea was that they should
      stick by the yacht until he got leisure to resume the voyage, or if he
      expected them to walk home. He had already given orders to the skipper to
      patch it up and bring it to New York if possible, and he advised his
      correspondents to stay by the yacht as long as there was anything in the
      larder, but if they were impatient, he offered them transportation on any
      vessel that would take able-bodied seamen. He must be excused from
      commanding, because he had been assigned to shore duty. Carmen and Miss
      Tavish wrote that it was unfair to leave them to sustain all the
      popularity and notoriety of the shipwreck, and that he owed it to the
      public to publish a statement, in reply to the insinuations of the
      newspapers, in regard to the sea-worthiness of the yacht and the object of
      this voyage. Jack replied that the only object of the voyage was to
      relieve the tedium of Bar Harbor, and, having accomplished this, he would
      present the vessel to Miss Tavish if she would navigate it back to the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden autumn days by the sea were little disturbed by these echoes of
      another life, which seemed at the moment to be a very shallow one. Yet the
      time was not without its undertone of anxieties, of grave perils that
      seemed to sanctify it and heighten its pleasures of hope. Jack saw and
      comprehended for the first time in his life the real nature of a pure
      woman, the depths of tenderness and self-abnegation, the heroism and calm
      trust and the nobility of an unworldly life. No wonder that he stood a
      little in awe of it, and days when he wandered down on the beach, with
      only the waves for company, or sat smoking in the arbor, with an unread
      book in his hand, his own career seemed petty and empty. Such moods,
      however, are not uncommon in any life, and are not of necessity fruitful.
      It need not be supposed that Jack took it too seriously, on the one hand,
      or, on the other, that a vision of such a woman&rsquo;s soul is ever without
      influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of October they returned to town, Jack, and Edith with a new
      and delicate attractiveness, and young Fletcher Delancy the most wonderful
      and important personage probably who came to town that season. It seemed
      to Edith that his advent would be universally remarked, and Jack felt
      relieved when the boy was safely housed out of the public gaze. Yes, to
      Edith&rsquo;s inexpressible joy it was a boy, and while Jack gallantly said that
      a girl would have suited him just as well, he was conscious of an
      increased pride when he announced the sex to his friends. This
      undervaluation of women at the start is one of the mysteries of life. And
      until women themselves change their point of view, it is to be feared that
      legislation will not accomplish all that many of them wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is a boy. I congratulate you,&rdquo; was the exclamation of Major Fairfax
      the first time Jack went down to the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, Major, to have your approval.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s what is expected, that&rsquo;s all. For my part, I prefer girls. The
      announcement of boys is more expensive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack understood, and it turned out in all the clubs that he had hit upon
      the most expensive sex in the view of responding to congratulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It used to seem to me,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;that I must have a male heir to
      my estates. But, somehow, as the years go on, I feel more like being an
      heir myself. If I had married and had a boy, he would have crowded me out
      by this time; whereas, if it had been a girl, I should no doubt have been
      staying at her place in Lenox this summer instead of being shipwrecked on
      that desert island. There is nothing, my dear boy, like a girl well
      invested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak with the feelings of a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak, sir, from observation. I look at society as it is, not as it
      would be if we had primogeniture and a landed aristocracy. A daughter
      under our arrangements is more likely to be a comfort to her parent in his
      declining years than a son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you seem, Major, to have preferred a single life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Circumstances&mdash;thank you, just a drop more&mdash;we are the
      creatures of circumstances. It is a long story. There were
      misrepresentation and misunderstanding. It is true, sir, that at that time
      my property was encumbered, but it was not unproductive. She died long
      ago. I have reason to believe that her married life was not happy. I was
      hot-blooded in those days, and my honor was touched, but I never blamed
      her. She was, at twenty, the most beautiful woman in Virginia. I have
      never seen her equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was more than the Major had ever revealed about his private life
      before. He had created an illusion about himself which society accepted,
      and in which he lived in apparent enjoyment of metropolitan existence.
      This was due to a sanguine temperament and a large imagination. And he had
      one quality that made him a favorite&mdash;a hearty enjoyment of the
      prosperity of others. With regard to himself, his imagination was
      creative, and Jack could not now tell whether this &ldquo;most beautiful woman
      of Virginia&rdquo; was not evoked by the third glass, about which the Major
      remarked, as he emptied it, that only this extraordinary occasion could
      justify such an indulgence at this time of day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courtly old gentleman had inquired about madam&mdash;indeed, the
      second glass had been dedicated to &ldquo;mother and child&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      exhibited a friendly and almost paternal interest, as he always did, in
      Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-way,&rdquo; he said, after a silence, &ldquo;is Henderson in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a good deal of uneasiness in the Street as to what he is
      doing. I hope you haven&rsquo;t got anything depending on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something in his stocks, if that is what you mean; but I don&rsquo;t
      mind telling you I have made something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s none of my business, only the Henderson stocks have gone off a
      little, as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack knew, and he asked the Major a little nervously if he knew anything
      further. The Major knew nothing except Street rumors. Jack was uneasy, for
      the Major was a sort of weathercock, and before he left the club he wrote
      to Mavick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried home with him a certain disquiet, to which he had been for
      months a stranger. Even the sight of Edith, who met him with a happy face,
      and dragged him away at once to see how lovely the baby looked asleep,
      could not remove this. It seemed strange that such a little thing should
      make a change, introduce an alien element into this domestic peace. Jack
      was like some other men who lose heart not when they are doing a doubtful
      thing, but when they have to face the consequences&mdash;cases of
      misplaced conscience. The peace and content that he had left in the house
      in the morning seemed to have gone out of it when he returned at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day came a reassuring letter from Mavick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was going on as usual. It was only a little bear movement, which
      wouldn&rsquo;t amount to anything. Still, day after day, the bears kept clawing
      down, and Jack watched the stock-list with increasing eagerness. He
      couldn&rsquo;t decide to sacrifice anything as long as he had a margin of
      profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state of mind it was impossible to consider any of the plans he
      had talked over with Edith before the baby was born. Inquiries he did make
      about some sort of position or regular occupation, and these he reported
      to Edith; but his heart was not in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days went by there was a little improvement in his stocks, and his
      spirits rose. But this mood was no more favorable than the other for
      beginning a new life, nor did there seem to be, as he went along, any need
      of it. He had an appearance of being busy every day; he rose late and went
      late to bed. It was the old life. Stocks down, there was a necessity of
      bracing up with whomever he met at any of the three or four clubs in which
      he lounged in the afternoon; and stocks up, there was reason for
      celebrating that fact in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was odd how soon he became accustomed to consider himself and to be
      regarded as the father of a family. That, also, like his marriage, seemed
      something done, and in a manner behind him. There was a commonplaceness
      about the situation. To Edith it was a great event. To Jack it was a
      milestone in life. He was proud of the boy; he was proud of Edith. &ldquo;I tell
      you, fellows,&rdquo; he would say at the club, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a great thing,&rdquo; and so on,
      in a burst of confidence, and he was quite sincere in this. But he
      preferred to be at the club and say these things rather than pass the same
      hours with his adorable family. He liked to think what he would do for
      that family&mdash;what luxuries he could procure for them, how they should
      travel and see the world. There wasn&rsquo;t a better father anywhere than Jack
      at this period. And why shouldn&rsquo;t a man of family amuse himself? Because
      he was happy in his family he needn&rsquo;t change all the habits of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he intended to look about him for something to do that would
      satisfy Edith and fill up his time; but meantime he drifted on,
      alternately anxious and elated, until the season opened. The Blunts and
      the Van Dams and the Chesneys and the Tavishes and Mrs. Henderson had
      called, invitations had poured in, subscriptions were asked, studies and
      gayeties were projected, and the real business of life was under way.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      To the nurse of the Delancy boy and to his mother he was by no means an
      old story or merely an incident of the year. He was an increasing wonder&mdash;new
      every morning, and exciting every evening. He was the centre of a world of
      solicitude and adoration. It would be scarcely too much to say that his
      coming into the world promised a new era, and his traits, his likes and
      dislikes, set a new standard in his court. If he had apprehended his
      position his vanity would have outgrown his curiosity about the world, but
      he displayed no more consciousness of his royalty than a kicking Infanta
      of Spain. This was greatly to his credit in the opinion of the nurse, who
      devoted herself to the baby with that enthusiasm of women for infants
      which fortunately never fails, and won the heart of Edith by her worship.
      And how much they found to say about this marvel! To hear from the nurse,
      over and over again, what the baby had done and had not done, in a given
      hour, was to Edith like a fresh chapter out of an exciting romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the boy&rsquo;s biographer is inclined to think that he had rare powers of
      discrimination, for one day when Carmen had called and begged to be
      permitted to go up into the nursery, and had asked to take him in her arms
      just for a moment, notwithstanding her soft dress and her caressing
      manner, Fletcher had made a wry face and set up a howl. &ldquo;How much he looks
      like his father&rdquo; (he didn&rsquo;t look like anything), Carmen said, handing him
      over to the nurse. What she thought was that in manner and disposition he
      was totally unlike Jack Delancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came down-stairs, Mrs. Schuyler Blunt was in the drawing-room.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had such a privilege, Mrs. Blunt, seeing the baby!&rdquo; cried Carmen, in
      her sweetest manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been,&rdquo; that lady rejoined, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen, who hated to be seen through, of all things, did not know whether
      to resent this or not. But Edith hastened to the rescue of her guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a privilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know, Mrs. Blunt,&rdquo; said Carmen, recovering herself and smiling,
      &ldquo;that I must have some excitement this dull season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blunt, with no relaxation of her manner; &ldquo;we are all
      grateful to Mrs. Delancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Henderson does herself injustice,&rdquo; Edith again interposed. &ldquo;I can
      assure you she has a great talent for domesticity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen did not much fancy this apology for her, but she rejoined: &ldquo;Yes,
      indeed. I&rsquo;m going to cultivate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this privileged person?&rdquo; Mrs. Blunt asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall see,&rdquo; said Edith. &ldquo;I am glad you came, for I wanted very much
      to consult you. I was going to send for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here I am. But I didn&rsquo;t come about the baby. I wanted to consult
      you. We miss you, dear, every day.&rdquo; And then Mrs. Blunt began to speak
      about some social and charitable arrangements, but stopped suddenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      see the baby first. Good-morning, Mrs. Henderson.&rdquo; And she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen felt as much left out socially as about the baby, and she also rose
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Edith. &ldquo;What kind of a summer have you had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very good. Some shipwrecks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Henderson? Is he well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly. He is away now. Husbands, you know, haven&rsquo;t so much talent for
      domesticity as we have.&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0247}.jpg" alt="{0247}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0247}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; Edith replied, simply, but with that spirit and air of
      breeding before which Carmen always inwardly felt defeat&mdash;&ldquo;that
      depends very much upon ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, with this absorption in the baby, Edith was slow to resume her
      old interests. Of course she knew of the illness of Father Damon, and the
      nurse, who was from the training-school in which Dr. Leigh was an
      instructor, and had been selected for this important distinction by the
      doctor, told her from time to time of affairs on the East Side. Over there
      the season had opened quite as usual; indeed, it was always open; work
      must go on every day, because every day food must be obtained and
      rent-money earned, and the change from summer to winter was only a
      climatic increase of hardships. Even an epidemic scare does not
      essentially vary the daily monotony, which is accepted with a dogged
      fatality:
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been no vacation for Ruth Leigh, and she jokingly said, when at
      length she got a half-hour for a visit to Edith, that she would hardly
      know what to do with one if she had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got through very well,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We always dread the summer,
      and we always dread the winter. Science has not yet decided which is the
      more fatal, decayed vegetables or unventilated rooms. City residence gives
      both a fair chance at the poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not the people learning anything?&rdquo; Edith asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, except to bear it, I am sorry to say. Even Father Damon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at work again? Do you see him often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, occasionally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should so like to see him. But I interrupted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Father Damon has come to see that nothing can be done without
      organization. The masses&rdquo;&mdash;and there was an accent of bitterness in
      her use of the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;must organize and fight for anything they
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Father Damon join in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he has always been a member of the Labor League. Now he has been at
      work with the Episcopal churches of the city, and got them to agree, when
      they want workmen for any purpose, to employ only union men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; Edith exclaimed, &ldquo;a surrender of individual rights and a
      great injustice to men not in the unions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would see it differently if you were in the struggle. If the
      working-men do not stand by each other, where are they to look for help?
      What have the Christians of this city done?&rdquo; and the little doctor got up
      and began to pace the room. &ldquo;Charities? Yes, little condescending
      charities. And look at the East Side! Is its condition any better? I tell
      you, Mrs. Delancy, I don&rsquo;t believe in charities&mdash;in any charities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Edith, with a smile calculated to mollify this
      vehemence, &ldquo;that you are a standing refutation of your own theory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? No, indeed. I&rsquo;m paid by the dispensary. And I make my patients pay&mdash;when
      they are able.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have heard,&rdquo; Edith retorted. &ldquo;Your bills must be a terror to the
      neighborhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may laugh. But I&rsquo;m establishing a reputation over there as a
      working-woman, and if I have any influence, or do any little good, it&rsquo;s
      owing to that fact. Do you think they care anything about Father Damon&rsquo;s
      gospel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be sorry to think they did not,&rdquo; Edith said, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, very little they care. They like the man because they think he
      shares their feelings, and does not sympathize with them because they are
      different from him. That is the only kind of gospel that is good for
      anything over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Father Damon would agree with you in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he would not. He&rsquo;s as mediaeval as any monk. But then he is not
      blind. He sees that it is never anything but personal influence that
      counts. Poor fellow,&rdquo; and the doctor&rsquo;s voice softened, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll kill himself
      with his ascetic notions. He is trying to take up the burden of this life
      while struggling under the terror of another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must be doing a great deal of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Nothing seems to do much good. But his presence is a
      great comfort. That is something. And I&rsquo;m glad he is going about now
      rousing opposition to what is, rather than all the time preaching
      submission to the lot of this life for the sake of a reward somewhere
      else. That&rsquo;s a gospel for the rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith was accustomed to hear Ruth Leigh talk in this bitter strain when
      this subject was introduced, and she contrived to turn the conversation
      upon what she called practical work, and then to ask some particulars of
      Father Damon&rsquo;s sudden illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did rest,&rdquo; the doctor said, &ldquo;for a little, in his way. But he will not
      spare himself, and he cannot stand it. I wish you could induce him to come
      here often&mdash;to do anything for diversion. He looks so worn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was in the appeal to Edith a note of personal interest which her
      quick heart did not fail to notice. And the thought came to her with a
      painful apprehension. Poor thing! Poor Father Damon!
    </p>
    <p>
      Does not each of them have to encounter misery enough without this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Doesn&rsquo;t life spare anybody?
    </p>
    <p>
      She told her apprehension to Jack when he came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack gave a long whistle. &ldquo;That is a deadlock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His vows, and her absolute materialism! Both of them would go to the
      stake for what they believe, or don&rsquo;t believe. It troubles me very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s interesting. It&rsquo;s what they call a situation.
      There. I didn&rsquo;t mean to make light of it. I don&rsquo;t believe there is
      anything in it. But it would be comical, right here in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be tragical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comedy usually is. I suppose it&rsquo;s the human nature in it. That is so
      difficult to get rid of. But I thought the missionary business was safe.
      Though, do you know, Edith, I should think better of both of them for
      having some human feeling. By-the-way, did Dr. Leigh say anything about
      Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has given Father Damon ten thousand dollars. It&rsquo;s in strict secrecy,
      but Father Damon said I might tell you. He said it was providential.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Mr. Henderson was wholly unscrupulous and cold as ice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s got a reputation for freeze-outs. If the Street knew this it
      would say it was insurance money. And he is so cynical that he wouldn&rsquo;t
      care what the Street said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it came about through Mrs. Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. She was speaking of Father Damon this morning in the
      Loan Exhibition. I don&rsquo;t believe she knows anything about it. Henderson is
      a good deal shut up in himself. They say at the Union that years ago he
      used to do a good many generous things&mdash;that he is a great deal
      harder than he used to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This talk was before dinner. She did not ask anything now about Carmen,
      though she knew that Jack had fallen into his old habit of seeing much of
      her. He was less and less at home, except at dinner-time, and he was often
      restless, and, she saw, often annoyed. When he was at home he tried to
      make up for his absence by extra tenderness and consideration for Edith
      and the boy. And this effort, and its evidence of a double if not divided
      life, wounded her more than the neglect. One night, when he came home
      late, he had been so demonstrative about the baby that Edith had sent the
      nurse out of the room until she could coax Jack to go into his own
      apartment. His fits of alternate good-humor and depression she tried to
      attribute to his business, to which he occasionally alluded without
      confiding in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Father Damon came in about luncheon-time. He apologized
      for not coming before since her return, but he had been a little upset,
      and his work was more and more interesting. His eyes were bright and his
      manner had quite the usual calm, but he looked pale and thinner, and so
      exhausted that Edith ran immediately for a glass of wine, and began to
      upbraid him for not taking better care of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take too much care of myself. We all do. The only thing I&rsquo;ve got to
      give is myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will not last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is of little moment; long or short, a man can only give himself. Our
      Lord was not here very long.&rdquo; And then Father Damon smiled, and said &ldquo;My
      dear friend, I&rsquo;m really doing very well. Of course I get tired. Then I
      come up again. And every now and then I get a lift. Did Jack tell you
      about Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Wasn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was more surprised. He sent for me to come to his office. Without
      any circumlocution, he asked me how I was getting on, and, before I could
      answer, he said, in the driest business way, that he had been thinking
      over a little plan, and perhaps I could help him. He had a little money he
      wanted to invest&mdash;RR&rdquo; &rsquo;In our mission chapel?&rsquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, without moving a muscle. &lsquo;Not that. I don&rsquo;t know much
      about chapels, Father Damon. But I&rsquo;ve been hearing what you are doing, and
      it occurred to me that you must come across a good many cases not in the
      regular charities that you could help judiciously, get them over hard
      spots, without encouraging dependence. I&rsquo;m going to put ten thousand
      dollars into your hands, if you&rsquo;ll be bothered with it, to use at your
      discretion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was taken aback, and I suppose I showed it, and I said that was a great
      deal of money to intrust to one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henderson showed a little impatience. It depended upon the man. That was
      his lookout. The money would be deposited, he said, in bank to my order,
      and he asked me for my signature that he could send with the deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I thanked him warmly, and said I hoped I could do some good
      with it. He did not seem to pay much attention to what I was saying. He
      was looking out of the window to the bare trees in the court back of his
      office, and his hands were moving the papers on his table aimlessly about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I shall know,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when you have drawn this out. I&rsquo;ve got a fancy
      for keeping a little fund of this sort there.&rsquo; And then he added, still
      not looking at me, but at the dead branches, &lsquo;You might call it the
      Margaret Fund.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the name of his first wife!&rdquo; Edith exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I remember. I said I would, and began to thank him again as I rose
      from my chair. He was still looking away, and saying, as if to himself, &lsquo;I
      think she would like that.&rsquo; And then he turned, and, in his usual abrupt
      office manner, said: &lsquo;Good-morning, good-morning. I am very much obliged
      to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it all very strange!&rdquo; Edith spoke, after a moment. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
      suppose he cared. Do you think it was just sentiment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Men like Henderson do queer things. In the hearts of
      such hardened men there are sometimes roots of sentiment that you wouldn&rsquo;t
      suspect. But I don&rsquo;t know. The Lord somehow looks out for his poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this windfall of charity, Father Damon seemed somewhat
      depressed. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;he had given it to the
      mission. We are so poor, and modern philanthropy all runs in other
      directions. The relief of temporary suffering has taken the place of the
      care of souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Dr. Leigh said that you were interesting the churches in the labor
      unions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is an effort to do something. The church must put herself into
      sympathetic relations with these people, or she will accomplish nothing.
      To get them into the church we must take up their burdens. But it is a
      long way round. It is not the old method of applying the gospel to men&rsquo;s
      sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Edith insisted, &ldquo;you must admit that such people as Dr. Leigh
      are doing a good work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon did not reply immediately. Presently he asked: &ldquo;Do you think,
      Mrs. Delancy, that Dr. Leigh has any sympathy with the higher life, with
      spiritual things? I wish I could think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the higher life of humanity, certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is too vague. I sometimes feel that she and those like her are
      the worst opponents to our work. They substitute humanitarianism for the
      gospel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I know of no one who works more than Ruth Leigh in the
      self-sacrificing spirit of the Master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom she denies!&rdquo; The quick reply came with a flush in his pale face, and
      he instantly arose and walked away to the window and stood for some
      moments in silence. When he turned there was another expression in his
      eyes and a note of tenderness in his voice that contradicted the severity
      of the priest. It was the man that spoke. &ldquo;Yes, she is the best woman I
      ever knew. God help me! I fear I am not fit for my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This outburst of Father Damon to her, so unlike his calm and trained
      manner, surprised Edith, although she had already some suspicion of his
      state of mind. But it would not have surprised her if she had known more
      of men, the necessity of the repressed and tortured soul for sympathy, and
      that it is more surely to be found in the heart of a pure woman than
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was nothing that she could say, as she took his hand to bid him
      good-by, except the commonplace that Dr. Leigh had expressed anxiety that
      he was overworking, and that for the sake of his work he must be more
      prudent. Yet her eyes expressed the sympathy she did not put in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon understood this, and he went away profoundly grateful for her
      forbearance of verbal expression as much as for her sympathy. But he did
      not suspect that she needed sympathy quite as much as he did, and
      consequently he did not guess the extent of her self-control. It would
      have been an immense relief to have opened her heart to him&mdash;and to
      whom could she more safely do this than to a priest set apart from all
      human entanglements?&mdash;and to have asked his advice. But Edith&rsquo;s
      peculiar strength&mdash;or was it the highest womanly instinct?&mdash;lay
      in her discernment of the truth that in one relation of life no
      confidences are possible outside of that relation except to its injury,
      and that to ask interference is pretty sure to seal its failure. As its
      highest joys cannot be participated in, so its estrangements cannot be
      healed by any influence outside of its sacred compact. To give confidence
      outside is to destroy the mutual confidence upon which the relation rests,
      and though interference may patch up livable compromises, the bloom of
      love and the joy of life are not in them. Edith knew that if she could not
      win her own battle, no human aid could win it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was all the more difficult because it was vague and indefinite, as
      the greater part of domestic tragedies are. For the most part life goes on
      with external smoothness, and the public always professes surprise when
      some accident, a suit at law, a sudden death, a contested will, a slip
      from apparent integrity, or family greed or feminine revenge, turns the
      light of publicity upon a household, to find how hollow the life has been;
      in the light of forgotten letters, revealing check-books, servants&rsquo;
      gossip, and long-established habits of aversion or forbearance, how much
      sordidness and meanness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was not everything going on as usual in the Delancy house and in the
      little world of which it was a part? If there had been any open neglect or
      jealousy, any quarrel or rupture, or any scene, these could be described.
      These would have an interest to the biographer and perhaps to the public.
      But at this period there was nothing of this sort to tell. There were no
      scenes. There were no protests or remonstrances or accusations, nor to the
      world was there any change in the daily life of these two.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more pitiful even than that. Here was a woman who had set her heart
      in all the passionate love of a pure ideal, and day by day she felt that
      the world, the frivolous world, with its low and selfish aims, was too
      strong for her, and that the stream was wrecking her life because it was
      bearing Jack away from her. What could one woman do against the accepted
      demoralizations of her social life? To go with them, not to care, to
      accept Jack&rsquo;s idle, good-natured, easy philosophy of life and conduct,
      would not that have insured a peaceful life? Why shouldn&rsquo;t she conform and
      float, and not mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, a wise woman, who has been blessed or cursed with a long
      experience of life, would have known that such a course could not forever,
      or for long, secure happiness, and that a man&rsquo;s love ultimately must rest
      upon a profound respect for his wife and a belief in her nobility. Perhaps
      Edith did not reason in this way. Probably it was her instinct for what
      was pure and true-showing, indeed, the quality of her love-that guided
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jack&rsquo;s friends he was much the same as usual. He simply went on in his
      ante-marriage ways. Perhaps he drank a little more, perhaps he was a
      little more reckless at cards, and it was certain that his taste for
      amusing himself in second-hand book-shops and antiquity collections had
      weakened. His talked-of project for some regular occupation seemed to have
      been postponed, although he said to himself that it was only postponed
      until his speculations, which kept him in a perpetual fever, should put
      him in a position to command a business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime he did not neglect social life&mdash;that is, the easy, tolerant
      company which lived as he liked to live. There was at first some pretense
      of declining invitations which Edith could not accept, but he soon fell
      into the habit of a man whose family has temporarily gone abroad, with the
      privileges of a married man, without the responsibilities of a bachelor.
      Edith could see that he took great credit to himself for any evenings he
      spent at home, and perhaps he had a sort of support in the idea that he
      was sacrificing himself to his family. Major Fairfax, whom Edith
      distrusted as a misleader of youth, did not venture to interfere with Jack
      again, but he said to himself that it was a blank shame that with such a
      wife he should go dangling about with women like Carmen and Miss Tavish,
      not that the Major himself had any objection to their society, but, hang
      it all, that was no reason why Jack should be a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In midwinter Jack went to Washington on business. It was necessary to see
      Mavick, and Mr. Henderson, who was also there. To spend a few weeks at the
      capital, in preparation for Lent, has become a part of the program of
      fashion. There can be met people like-minded from all parts of the Union,
      and there is gayety, and the entertainment to be had in new acquaintances,
      without incurring any of the responsibilities of social continuance. They
      meet there on neutral ground. Half Jack&rsquo;s set had gone over or were going.
      Young Van Dam would go with him. It will be only for a few days, Jack had
      said, gayly, when he bade Edith good-by, and she must be careful not to
      let the boy forget him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite by accident, apparently, that in the same train were the
      Chesneys, Miss Tavish, and Carmen going over to join her husband. This
      gave the business expedition the air of an excursion. And indeed at the
      hotel where they stayed this New York contingent made something of an
      impression, promising an addition to the gayety of the season, and
      contributing to the importance of the house as a centre of fashion.
      Henderson&rsquo;s least movements were always chronicled and speculated on, and
      for years he had been one of the stock subjects, out of which even the
      dullest interviewers, who watch the hotel registers in all parts of the
      country, felt sure that they could make an acceptable paragraph. The
      arrival of his wife, therefore, was a newspaper event.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said in Washington at the time that Mrs. Henderson was one of the
      most fascinating of women, amiable, desirous to please, approachable, and
      devoted to the interests of her husband. If some of the women, residents
      in established society, were a little shy of her, if some, indeed, thought
      her dangerous&mdash;women are always thinking this of each other, and
      surely they ought to know-nothing of this appeared in the reports. The men
      liked her. She had so much vivacity, such esprit, she understood men so
      well, and the world, and could make allowances, and was always an
      entertaining companion. More than one Senator paid marked court to her,
      more than one brilliant young fellow of the House thought himself
      fortunate if he sat next her at dinner, and even cabinet officers waited
      on her at supper. It could not be doubted that a smile and a confidential
      or a witty remark from Mrs. Henderson brightened many an evening. Wherever
      she went her charming toilets were fully described, and the public knew as
      well as her jewelers the number and cost of her diamonds, her necklaces,
      her tiaras. But this was for the world and for state occasions. At home
      she liked simplicity. And this was what impressed the reporters when, in
      the line of their public duty, they were admitted to her presence. With
      them she was very affable, and she made them feel that they could almost
      be classed with her friends, and that they were her guardians against the
      vulgar publicity, which she disliked and shrank from.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0265}.jpg" alt="{0265}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0265}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      There went abroad, therefore, an impression of her amiability, her
      fabulous wealth in jewels and apparel, her graciousness and her cleverness
      and her domesticity. Her manners seemed to the reporters those of a
      &ldquo;lady,&rdquo; and of this both her wit and freedom from prudishness and her
      courteous treatment of them convinced them. And the best of all this was
      that while it was said that Henderson was one of the boldest and shrewdest
      of operators, and a man to be feared in the Street, he was in his family
      relations one of the most generous and kind-hearted of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson himself had not much time for the frivolities of the season, and
      he evaded all but the more conspicuous social occasions, at which Carmen,
      sometimes with a little temper, insisted that he should accompany her.
      &ldquo;You would come here,&rdquo; he once said, &ldquo;when you knew I was immersed in most
      perplexing business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I am here,&rdquo; she had replied, in a tone equally wanting in
      softness, &ldquo;you have got to make the best of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was Jack happy in the whirl he was in? Some days exceedingly so. Some days
      he sulked, and some days he threw himself with recklessness born of
      artificial stimulants into the always gay and rattling moods of Miss
      Tavish. Somehow he could get no nearer to Henderson or to Mavick than when
      he was in New York. Not that he could accuse Mavick of trying to conceal
      anything; Mavick bore to him always the open, &ldquo;all right&rdquo; attitude, but
      there were things that he did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Carmen? Was she a little less dependent on him, in this wide
      horizon, than in New York? And had he noticed a little disposition to
      patronize on two or three occasions? It was absurd. He laughed at himself
      for such an idea. Old Eschelle&rsquo;s daughter patronize him! And yet there was
      something. She was very confidential with Mavick. They seemed to have a
      great deal in common. It so happened that even in the little expeditions
      of sightseeing these two were thrown much together, and at times when the
      former relations of Jack and Carmen should have made them comrades. They
      had a good deal to say to each other, and momentarily evidently serious
      things, and at receptions Jack had interrupted their glances of
      intelligence. But what stuff this was! He jealous of the attentions of his
      friend to another man&rsquo;s wife! If she was a coquette, what did it matter to
      him? Certainly he was not jealous. But he was irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day after a round of receptions, in which Jack had been specially
      disgruntled, and when he was alone in the drawing-room of the hotel with
      Carmen, his manner was so positively rude to her that she could not but
      notice it. There was this trait of boyishness in Jack, and it was one of
      the weaknesses that made him loved, that he always cried out when he was
      hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Carmen resent this? Did she upbraid him for his manner? Did she
      apologize, as if she had done anything to provoke it? She sank down
      wearily in a chair and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired. I wish I were back in New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t act like it,&rdquo; Jack replied, gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You don&rsquo;t understand. And now you want to make me more miserable. See
      here, Mr. Delancy,&rdquo; and she started up in her seat and turned to him, &ldquo;you
      are a man of honor. Would you advise me to make an enemy of Mr. Mavick,
      knowing all that he does know about Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s affairs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what that has got to do with it,&rdquo; said Jack, wavering.
      &ldquo;Lately your manner&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Carmen, springing up and approaching Jack with a smile
      of animation and trust, and laying her hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;We are old,
      old friends. And I have just confided to you what I wouldn&rsquo;t to any other
      living being. There!&rdquo; And looking around at the door, she tapped him
      lightly on the cheek and ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever you might say of Carmen, she had this quality of a wise person,
      that she never cut herself loose from one situation until she was entirely
      sure of a better position.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one reason or another Jack&rsquo;s absence was prolonged. He wrote often, he
      made bright comments on the characters and peculiarities of the capital,
      and he said that he was tired to death of the everlasting whirl and
      scuffle. People plunged in the social whirlpool always say they are weary
      of it, and they complain bitterly of its exactions and its tax on their
      time and strength. Edith judged, especially from the complaints, that her
      husband was enjoying himself. She felt also that his letters were in a
      sense perfunctory, and gave her only the surface of his life. She sought
      in vain in them for those evidences of spontaneous love, of delight in
      writing to her of all persons in the world, the eagerness of the lover
      that she recalled in letters written in other days. However affectionate
      in expression, these were duty letters. Edith was not alone. She had no
      lack of friends, who came and went in the common round of social exchange,
      and for many of them she had a sincere affection. And there were plenty of
      relatives on the father&rsquo;s and on the mother&rsquo;s side. But for the most part
      they were old-fashioned, home-keeping New-Yorkers, who were sufficient to
      themselves, and cared little for the set into which Edith&rsquo;s marriage had
      more definitely placed her. In any real trouble she would not have lacked
      support. She was deemed fortunate in her marriage, and in her apparent
      serene prosperity it was believed that she was happy. If she had had
      mother or sister or brother, it is doubtful if she would have made either
      a confidant of her anxieties, but high-spirited and self-reliant as she
      was, there were days when she longed with intolerable heartache for the
      silent sympathy of a mother&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is singular how lonely a woman of this nature can be in a gay and
      friendly world. She had her interests, to be sure. As she regained her
      strength she took up her social duties, and she tried to resume her
      studies, her music, her reading, and she occupied herself more and more
      with the charities and the fortunes of her friends who were giving their
      lives to altruistic work. But there was a sense of unreality in all this.
      The real thing was the soul within, the longing, loving woman whose heart
      was heavy and unsatisfied. Jack was so lovable, he had in his nature so
      much nobility, if the world did not kill it, her life might be so sweet,
      and so completely fulfill her girlish dreams. All these schemes of a
      helpful, altruistic life had been in her dream, but how empty it was
      without the mutual confidence, the repose in the one human love for which
      she cared.

      Though she was not alone, she had no confidant. She could have none. What
      was there to confide? There was nothing to be done. There was no flagrant
      wrong or open injustice. Some women in like circumstances become bitter
      and cynical. Others take their revenge in a career reckless, but within
      social conventions, going their own way in a sort of matrimonial truce.
      These are not noticeable tragedies. They are things borne with a dumb ache
      of the heart. There are lives into which the show of spring comes, but
      without the song of birds or the scent of flowers. They are endured
      bravely, with a heroism for which the world does not often give them
      credit. Heaven only knows how many noble women-noble in this if in nothing
      else&mdash;carry through life this burden of an unsatisfied heart, mocked
      by the outward convention of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Edith had one confidant&mdash;the boy. And he was perfectly safe; he
      would reveal nothing. There were times when he seemed to understand, and
      whether he did or not she poured out her heart to him. Often in the
      twilight she sat by him in this silent communion. If he were asleep&mdash;and
      he was not troubled with insomnia&mdash;he was still company. And when he
      was awake, his efforts to communicate the dawning ideas of the queer world
      into which he had come were a never-failing delight. He wanted so many
      more things than he could ask for, which it was his mother&rsquo;s pleasure to
      divine; later on he would ask for so many things he could not get. The
      nurse said that he had uncommon strength of will.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were happy hours, imagining what the boy would be, planning what she
      would make his life, hours enjoyed as a traveler enjoys wayside flowers,
      snatched before an approaching storm. It is a pity, the nurse would say,
      that his father cannot see him now. And at the thought Edith could only
      see the child through tears, and a great weight rested on her heart in all
      this happiness.

      When Father Damon parted from Edith he seemed to himself strengthened in
      his spirit. His momentary outburst had shown him where he stood-the
      strength of his fearful temptation. To see it was to be able to conquer
      it. He would humiliate himself; he would scourge himself; he would fast
      and pray; he would throw himself more unreservedly into the service of his
      Master. He had been too compromising with sin and sinners, and with his
      own weakness and sin, the worst of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest walked swiftly through the wintry streets, welcoming as a sort
      of penance the biting frost which burned his face and penetrated his
      garments. He little heeded the passers in the streets, those who hurried
      or those who loitered, only, if he met or passed a woman or a group of
      girls, he instinctively drew himself away and walked more rapidly. He
      strode on uncompromisingly, and his clean-shaved face was set in rigid
      lines. Those who saw him pass would have said that there went an ascetic
      bent on judgment. Many who did know him, and who ordinarily would have
      saluted him, sure of a friendly greeting, were repelled by his stern face
      and determined air, and made no sign. The father had something on his
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned into Rivington Street there approached him from the opposite
      direction a girl, walking slowly and undecidedly. When he came near her
      she looked up, with an appealing recognition. In a flash of the quick
      passing he thought he knew her&mdash;a girl who had attended his mission
      and whom he had not seen for several months-but he made no sign and passed
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father Damon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned about short at the sound of the weak, pleading voice, but with
      no relaxation of his severe, introverted mood. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the girl he remembered. She wore a dress of silk that had once been
      fine, and over it an ample cloak that had quite lost its freshness, and a
      hat still gay with cheap flowers. Her face, which had a sweet and almost
      innocent expression, was drawn and anxious. The eyes were those of a
      troubled and hunted animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; she said, hesitatingly, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know you. Why haven&rsquo;t you been at the mission lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t come. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have fallen into bad ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer immediately. She looked away, and, still avoiding his
      gaze, said, timidly: &ldquo;I thought I would tell you, Father Damon, that I&rsquo;m&mdash;that
      I&rsquo;m in trouble. I don&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you repented of your sin?&rdquo; asked he, with a little softening of his
      tone. &ldquo;Did you want to come to me for help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s deserted me,&rdquo; said the girl, looking down, absorbed in her own
      misery, and not heeding his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, so that is what you are sorry for?&rdquo; The severe, reproving tone had
      come back to his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they don&rsquo;t want me in the shop any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest hesitated. Was he always to preach against sin, to strive to
      extirpate it, and yet always to make it easy for the sinner? This girl
      must realize her guilt before he could do her any good. &ldquo;Are you sorry for
      what you have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she replied. Wasn&rsquo;t to be in deep trouble to be sorry?
      And then she looked up, and continued with the thought in her mind, &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t know who else to go to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my child, if you are sorry, and want to lead a different life, come
      to me at the mission and I will try to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest, with a not unkindly good-by, passed on. The girl stood a
      moment irresolute, and then went on her way heavily and despondent. What
      good would it do her to go to the mission now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later Dr. Leigh was waiting at the mission chapel to speak with
      the rector after the vesper service. He came out pale and weary, and the
      doctor hesitated to make known her errand when she saw how exhausted he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you wish me for anything?&rdquo; he asked, after the rather forced
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel able. There is a girl at the Woman&rsquo;s Hospital who wants to
      see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the girl you saw on the street the other afternoon; she said she
      had spoken to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She promised to come to the mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t. I met the poor thing the same afternoon. She looked so
      aimless and forlorn that, though I did not remember her at first, I
      thought she might be ill, and spoke to her, and asked her what was the
      matter. At first she said nothing except that she was out of work and felt
      miserable; but the next moment she broke down completely, and said she
      hadn&rsquo;t a friend in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; said the priest, with a pang of self-reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing to do but to take her to the hospital, and there she
      has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she very ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may live, the house surgeon says. But she was very weak for such a
      trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little more was said as they walked along, and when they reached the
      hospital, Father Damon was shown without delay into the ward where the
      sick girl lay. Dr. Leigh turned back from the door, and the nurse took him
      to the bedside. She lay quite still in her cot, wan and feeble, with every
      sign of having encountered a supreme peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head on the low pillow as Father Damon spoke, saying he was
      very glad he could come to her, and hoped she was feeling better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would come,&rdquo; she said, feebly. &ldquo;The nurse says I&rsquo;m better. But
      I wanted to tell you&mdash;&rdquo; And she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Lord is very good. He will forgive all your
      sins now, if you repent and trust Him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope&mdash;&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so weak. If I don&rsquo;t live I want him to
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want whom to know?&rdquo; asked the father, bending over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She signed for him to come closer, and then whispered a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only if I never see him again, if you see him, you will tell him that I
      was always true to him. He said such hard words. I was always true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; said the father, much moved. &ldquo;But now, my child, you ought to
      think of yourself, of your&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead. Didn&rsquo;t they tell you? There is nothing any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse approached with a warning gesture that the interview was too
      prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon knelt for a moment by the bedside, uttering a hardly
      articulate prayer. The girl&rsquo;s eyes were closed. When he rose she opened
      them with a look of gratitude, and with the sign of blessing he turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He intended to hasten from the house. He wanted to be alone. His trouble
      seemed to him greater than that of the suffering girl. What had he done?
      What was he in thought better than she? Was this intruding human element
      always to cross the purpose of his spiritual life?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was passing through the wide hallway the door of the reception-room
      was open, and he saw Dr. Leigh seated at the table, with a piece of work
      in her hands. She looked up, and stopped him with an unspoken inquiry in
      her face. It was only civil to pause a moment and tell her about the
      patient, and as he stepped within the room she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should rest a moment, Father Damon. I know what these scenes are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yielding weakly, as he knew, he took the offered chair. But he raised his
      hand in refusal of the glass of wine which she had ready for him on the
      table, and offered before he could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must,&rdquo; she said, with a smile. &ldquo;It is the doctor&rsquo;s prescription.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not look like a doctor. She had laid aside the dusty
      walking-dress, the business-jacket, the ugly little hat of felt, the
      battered reticule. In her simple house costume she was the woman,
      homelike, sympathetic, gentle, with the everlasting appeal of the strong
      feminine nature. It was not a temptress who stood before him, but a
      helpful woman, in whose kind eyes-how beautiful they were in this moment
      of sympathy&mdash;there was trust&mdash;and rest&mdash;and peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said, when he had taken the much-needed draught; &ldquo;in the
      hospital you must obey the rules, one of which is to let no one sink in
      exhaustion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had taken her seat now, and resumed her work. Father Damon was looking
      at her, seeing the woman, perhaps, as he never had seen her before, a
      certain charm in her quiet figure and modest self-possession, while the
      thought of her life, of her labors, as he had seen her now for months and
      months of entire sacrifice of self, surged through his brain in a whirl of
      emotion that seemed sweeping him away. But when he spoke it was of the
      girl, and as if to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sorry to let her go that day. Friendless, I should have known. I
      did know. I should have felt. You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, gently, interrupting him; &ldquo;that was my business. You
      should not accuse yourself. It was a physician&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a physician&mdash;the great Physician. The Master never let the sin
      hinder his compassion for the sinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this she could make no reply. Presently she looked up and said: &ldquo;But I
      am sure your visit was a great comfort to the poor girl! She was very
      eager to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His air was still abstracted. He was hardly thinking of the girl, after
      all, but of himself, of the woman who sat before him. It seemed to him
      that he would have given the world to escape&mdash;to fly from her, to fly
      from himself. Some invisible force held him&mdash;a strong, new, and yet
      not new, emotion, a power that seemed to clutch his very life. He could
      not think clearly about it. In all his discipline, in his consecration, in
      his vows of separation from the world, there seemed to have been no shield
      prepared for this. The human asserted itself, and came in, overwhelming
      his guards and his barriers like a strong flood in the spring-time of the
      year, breaking down all artificial contrivances. &ldquo;They reckon ill who
      leave me out,&rdquo; is the everlasting cry of the human heart, the great
      passion of life, incarnate in the first man and the first woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a supreme effort of his iron will&mdash;is the Will, after all,
      stronger than Love?&mdash;Father Damona rose. He stretched out his hand to
      say farewell. She also stood, and she felt the hand tremble that held
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are so good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was going. He took her other hand, and was looking down upon her face.
      She looked up, and their eyes met. It was for an instant, a flash, glance
      for glance, as swift as the stab of daggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the power of heaven and earth could not recall that glance nor undo
      its revelations. The man and the woman stood face to face revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down towards her face. Affrighted by his passion, scarcely able to
      stand in her sudden emotion, she started back. The action, the instant of
      time, recalled him to himself. He dropped her hands, and was gone. And the
      woman, her knees refusing any longer to support her, sank into a chair,
      helpless, and saw him go, and knew in that moment the height of a woman&rsquo;s
      joy, the depth of a woman&rsquo;s despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had come to her! Steeled by her science, shielded by her philanthropy,
      schooled in indifference to love, it had come to her! And it was hopeless.
      Hopeless? It was absurd. Her life was determined. In no event could it be
      in harmony with his opinions, with his religion, which was dearer to him
      than life. There was a great gulf between them which she could not pass
      unless she ceased to be herself. And he? A severe priest! Vowed and
      consecrated against human passion! What a government of the world&mdash;if
      there were any government&mdash;that could permit such a thing! It was
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she was loved! That sang in her heart with all the pain, with all
      the despair. And with it all was a great pity for him, alone, gone into
      the wilderness, as it would seem to him, to struggle with his fierce
      temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had come on darker as she sat there. The lamps were lighted, and she
      was reminded of some visits she must make. She went, mechanically, to her
      room to prepare for going. The old jacket, which she took up, did look
      rather rusty. She went to the press&mdash;it was not much of a wardrobe&mdash;and
      put on the one that was reserved for holidays. And the hat? Her friends
      had often joked her about the hat, but now for the first time she seemed
      to see it as it might appear to others. As she held it in her hand, and
      then put it on before the mirror, she smiled a little, faintly, at its
      appearance. And then she laid it aside for her better hat. She never had
      been so long in dressing before. And in the evening, too, when it could
      make no difference! It might, after all, be a little more cheerful for her
      forlorn patients. Perhaps she was not conscious that she was making
      selections, that she was paying a little more attention to her toilet than
      usual. Perhaps it was only the woman who was conscious that she was loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to say what emotion was uppermost in the mind of
      Father Damon as he left the house&mdash;mortification, contempt of
      himself, or horror. But there was a sense of escape, of physical escape,
      and the imperative need of it, that quickened his steps almost into a run.
      In the increasing dark, at this hour, in this quarter of the town, there
      were comparatively few whose observation of him would recall him to
      himself. He thought only of escape, and of escape from that quarter of the
      city that was the witness of his labors and his failure. For the moment to
      get away from this was the one necessity, and without reasoning in the
      matter, only feeling, he was hurrying, stumbling in his haste, northward.
      Before he went to the hospital he had been tired, physically weary. He was
      scarcely conscious of it now; indeed, his body, his hated body, seemed
      lighter, and the dominant spirit now awakened to contempt of it had a
      certain pleasure in testing it, in drawing upon its vitality, to the point
      of exhaustion if possible. It should be seen which was master. His rapid
      pace presently brought him into one of the great avenues leading to
      Harlem. That was the direction he wished to go. That was where he knew,
      without making any decision, he must go, to the haven of the house of his
      order, on the heights beyond Harlem. A train was just clattering along on
      the elevated road above him. He could see the faces at the windows, the
      black masses crowding the platforms. It went pounding by as if it were
      freight from another world. He was in haste, but haste to escape from
      himself. That way, bearing him along with other people, and in the moving
      world, was to bring him in touch with humanity again, and so with what was
      most hateful in himself. He must be alone. But there was a deeper
      psychological reason than that for walking, instead of availing himself of
      the swiftest method of escape. He was not fleeing from justice or pursuit.
      When the mind is in torture and the spirit is torn, the instinctive effort
      is to bodily activity, to force physical exertion, as if there must be
      compensation for the mental strain in the weariness of nature. The priest
      obeyed this instinct, as if it were possible to walk away from himself,
      and went on, at first with almost no sense of weariness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the shame! He could not bear to be observed. It seemed to him that
      every one would see in his face that he was a recreant priest, perjured
      and forsworn. And so great had been his spiritual pride! So removed he had
      deemed himself from the weakness of humanity! And he had yielded at the
      first temptation, and the commonest of all temptations! Thank God, he had
      not quite yielded. He had fled. And yet, how would it have been if Ruth
      Leigh had not had a moment of reserve, of prudent repulsion! He groaned in
      anguish. The sin was in the intention. It was no merit of his that he had
      not with a kiss of passion broken his word to his Lord and lost his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was remorse that was driving him along the avenue; no room for any
      other thought yet, or feeling. Perhaps it is true in these days that the
      old-fashioned torture known as remorse is rarely experienced except under
      the name of detection. But it was a reality with this highly sensitive
      nature, with this conscience educated to the finest edge of feeling. The
      world need never know his moment&rsquo;s weakness; Ruth Leigh he could trust as
      he would have trusted his own sister to guard his honor&mdash;that was all
      over&mdash;never, he was sure, would she even by a look recall the past;
      but he knew how he had fallen, and the awful measure of his lapse from
      loyalty to his Master. And how could he ever again stand before erring,
      sinful men and women and speak about that purity which he had violated?
      Could repentance, confession, penitence, wipe away this stain?
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went on, his mind in a whirl of humiliation, self-accusation, and
      contempt, at length he began to be conscious of physical weariness. Except
      the biscuit and the glass of wine at the hospital, he had taken nothing
      since his light luncheon. When he came to the Harlem Bridge he was
      compelled to rest. Leaning against one of the timbers and half seated,
      with the softened roar of the city in his ears, the lights gleaming on the
      heights, the river flowing dark and silent, he began to be conscious of
      his situation. Yes, he was very tired. It seemed difficult to go on
      without help of some sort. At length he crossed the bridge. Lights were
      gleaming from the saloons along the street. He paused in front of one,
      irresolute. Food he could not taste, but something he must have to carry
      him on. But no, that would not do; he could not enter that in his priest&rsquo;s
      garb. He dragged himself along until he came to a drug-shop, the modern
      saloon of the respectably virtuous. That he entered, and sat down on a
      stool by the soda-water counter. The expectant clerk stared at him while
      waiting the order, his hand tentatively seeking one of the faucets of
      refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel a little feverish,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;You may give me five grains
      of quinine in whisky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll put you all right,&rdquo; said the boy as he handed him the mixture.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to revive him, and he went out and walked on towards the
      heights. Somehow, seeing this boy, coming back to common life, perhaps the
      strong and unaccustomed stimulant, gave a new shade to his thoughts. He
      was safe. Presently he would be at the Retreat. He would rest, and then
      gird up his loins and face life again. The mood lasted for some time. And
      when the sense of physical weariness came back, that seemed to dull the
      acuteness of his spiritual torment. It was late when he reached the house
      and rang the night-bell. No one of the brothers was up except Father
      Monies, and it was he who came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! So late! Is anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needed to come,&rdquo; the father said, simply, and he grasped the door-post,
      steadying himself as he came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look like a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;m tired. I walked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walked? From Rivington Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly. I felt like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s most imprudent. You dined first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have something at once.&rdquo; And Father Monies hurried away,
      heated some bouillon by a spirit-lamp, and brought it, with bread, and set
      it before his unexpected guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, eat that, and get to bed as soon as you can. It was great
      nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Father Damon obeyed. Indeed, he was too exhausted to talk.

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Father Damon slept the sleep of exhaustion. In this for a time the mind
      joined in the lethargy of the body. But presently, as the vital currents
      were aroused, the mind began to play its fantastic tricks. He was a
      seminary student, he was ordained, he was taking his vows before the
      bishop, he was a robust and consecrated priest performing his first
      service, shining, it seemed to him, before the congregation in the purity
      of his separation from the world. How strong he felt. And then came
      perplexities, difficulties, interests, and conflicting passions in life
      that he had not suspected, good that looked like evil, and evil that had
      an alloy of virtue, and the way was confused. And then there was a vision
      of a sort of sister of charity working with him in the evil and the good,
      drawing near to him, and yet repelling him with a cold, scientific
      skepticism that chilled him like blasphemy; but so patient was she, so
      unconscious of self, that gradually he lost this feeling of repulsion and
      saw only the woman, that wonderful creation, tender, pitiful comrade, the
      other self. And then there was darkness and blindness, and he stood once
      more before his congregation, speaking words that sounded hollow, hearing
      responses that mocked him, stared at by accusing eyes that knew him for a
      hypocrite. And he rushed away and left them, hearing their laughter as he
      went, and so into the street&mdash;plainly it was Rivington Street&mdash;and
      faces that he knew had a smile and a sneer, and he heard comments as he
      passed &ldquo;Hulloa, Father Damon, come in and have a drink.&rdquo; &ldquo;I say, Father
      Damon, I seen her going round into Grand Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Father Monies looked in, just before daylight, Father Damon was still
      sleeping, but tossing restlessly and muttering incoherently; and he did
      not arouse him for the early devotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very late when he awoke, and opened his eyes to a confused sense of
      some great calamity. Father Monies was standing by the bedside with a cup
      of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a good sleep. Now take this, and then you may get up. The
      breakfast will wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon started up. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you call me? I am late for the
      mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bendes has gone down long ago. You must take it easy; rest today.
      You&rsquo;ll be all right. You haven&rsquo;t a bit of fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; still declining the coffee, &ldquo;before I break my fast, I have
      something to say to you. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get some strength first. Besides, I have an engagement. I cannot wait.
      Pull yourself together; I may not be back before evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was fated that he should be left still with himself. After his
      coffee he dressed slowly, as if it were not he, but some one else going
      through this familiar duty, as if it were scarcely worth while to do
      anything any more. And then, before attempting his breakfast, he went into
      the little oratory, and remained long in the attitude of prayer, trying to
      realize what he was and what he had done. He prayed for himself, for help,
      for humility, and he prayed for her; he had been used of late to pray for
      her guidance, now he prayed that she might be sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came forth it was in a calmer frame of mind. It was all clear now.
      When Father Monies returned he would confess, and take his penance, and
      resolutely resume his life. He understood life better now. Perhaps this
      blow was needed for his spiritual pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mild winter day, bright, and with a touch of summer, such as
      sometimes gets shuffled into our winter calendar. The book that he took up
      did not interest him; he was in no mood for the quiet meditation that it
      usually suggested to him, and he put it down and strolled out, directing
      his steps farther up the height, and away from the suburban stir. As he
      went on there was something consonant with his feelings in the bare wintry
      landscape, and when he passed the ridge and walked along the top of the
      river slope, he saw, as it seemed to him he had not seen it before, that
      lovely reach of river, the opposite wooded heights, the noble pass above,
      the peacefulness and invitation of nature. Had he a new sense to see all
      this? There was a softness in the distant outline, villas peeped out here
      and there, carriages were passing in the road below, there was a cheerful
      life in the stream&mdash;there was a harmony in the aspect of nature and
      humanity from this height. Was not the world beautiful? and human emotion,
      affection, love, were they alien to the Divine intention?
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved beauty; she was fond of flowers; often she had spoken to him of
      her childish delight in her little excursions, rarely made, into the
      country. He could see her now standing just there and feasting her eyes on
      this noble panorama, and he could see her face all aglow, as she might
      turn to him and say, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it beautiful, Father Damon?&rdquo; And she was down
      in those reeking streets, climbing about in the foul tenement-houses,
      taking a sick child in her arms, speaking a word of cheer&mdash;a good
      physician going about doing good!
    </p>
    <p>
      And it might have been! Why was it that this peace of nature should bring
      up her image, and that they should seem in harmony? Was not the love of
      beauty and of goodness the same thing? Did God require in His service the
      atrophy of the affections? As long as he was in the world was it right
      that he should isolate himself from any of its sympathies and trials? Why
      was it not a higher life to enter into the common lot, and suffer, if need
      be, in the struggle to purify and ennoble all? He remembered the days he
      had once passed in the Trappist monastery of Gethsemane. The perfect peace
      of mind of the monks was purchased at the expense of the extirpation of
      every want, all will, every human interest. Were these men anything but
      specimens in a Museum of Failures? And yet, for the time being, it had
      seemed attractive to him, this simple vegetable existence, whose only
      object was preparation for death by the extinction of all passion and
      desire. No, these were not soldiers of the Lord, but the fainthearted, who
      had slunk into the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this afternoon he was drifting in thought, arraigning his past life,
      excusing it, condemning it, and trying to forecast its future. Was this a
      trial of his constancy and faith, or had he made a mistake, entered upon a
      slavish career, from which he ought to extricate himself at any cost of
      the world&rsquo;s opinion? But presently he was aware that in all these debates
      with himself her image appeared. He was trying to fit his life to the
      thought of her. And when this became clearer in his tortured mind, the
      woman appeared as a temptation. It was not, then, the love of beauty, not
      even the love of humanity, and very far from being the service of his
      Master, that he was discussing, but only his desire for one person. It was
      that, then, that made him, for that fatal instant, forget his vow, and
      yield to the impulse of human passion. The thought of that moment stung
      him with confusion and shame. There had been moments in this afternoon
      wandering&mdash;when it had seemed possible for him to ask for release,
      and to take up a human, sympathetic life with her, in mutual consecration
      in the service of the Lord&rsquo;s poor. Yes, and by love to lead her into a
      higher conception of the Divine love. But this breaking a solemn vow at
      the dictates of passion was a mortal sin&mdash;there was no other name for
      it&mdash;a sin demanding repentance and expiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he at last turned homeward, facing the great city and his life there,
      this became more clear to him. He walked rapidly. The lines of his face
      became set in a hard judgment of himself. He thought no more of escaping
      from himself, but of subduing himself, stamping out the appeals of his
      lower nature. It was in this mood that he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Monies was awaiting him, and welcomed him with that look of
      affection, of more than brotherly love, which the good man had for the
      younger priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your walk has done you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Father Damon replied, without any leniency in his face; &ldquo;but
      that does not matter. I must tell you what I could not last night. Can you
      hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went together into the oratory. Father Damon did not spare himself.
      He kept nothing back that could heighten the enormity of his offense.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Father Monies did not attempt to lessen the impression upon himself of
      the seriousness of the scandal. He was shocked. He was exceedingly grave,
      but he was even more pitiful. His experience of life had been longer than
      that of the penitent. He better knew its temptations. His own peace had
      only been won by long crucifixion of the natural desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to say as to your own discipline. That you know. But there
      is one thing. You must face this temptation, and subdue it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that I must go back to my labor in the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You can rest here a few days if you feel too weak physically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am well enough.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;I thought perhaps some other field,
      for a time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no other field for you. It is not for the moment the question of
      where you can do most good. You are to reinstate yourself. You are a
      soldier of the Lord Jesus, and you are to go where the battle is most
      dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the substance of it all. There was much affectionate counsel and
      loving sympathy mingled with all the inflexible orders of obedience, but
      the sin must be faced and extirpated in presence of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow Father Damon went back to his solitary rooms, to his chapel,
      to the round of visitations, to his work with the poor, the sinful, the
      hopeless. He did not seek her; he tried not to seem to avoid her, or to
      seem to shun the streets where he was most likely to meet her, and the
      neighborhoods she frequented. Perhaps he did avoid them a little, and he
      despised himself for doing it. Almost involuntarily he looked to the bench
      by the chapel door which she occasionally occupied at vespers. She was
      never there, and he condemned himself for thinking that she might be; but
      yet wherever he walked there was always the expectation that he might
      encounter her. As the days went by and she did not appear, his expectation
      became a kind of torture. Was she ill, perhaps? It could not be that she
      had deserted her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he began to examine himself with a morbid introspection. Had the
      hope that he should see her occasionally influenced him at all in his
      obedience to Father Monies? Had he, in fact, a longing to be in the
      streets where she had walked, among the scenes that had witnessed her
      beautiful devotion? Had his willingness to take up this work again been
      because it brought him nearer to her in spirit?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she could not be ill. He heard her spoken of, here and there, in his
      calls and ministrations to the sick and dying. Evidently she was going
      about her work as usual. Perhaps she was avoiding him. Or perhaps she did
      not care, after all, and had lost her respect for him when he discovered
      to her his weakness. And he had put himself on a plane so high above her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no conscious wavering in his purpose. But from much dwelling
      upon the thought, from much effort rather to put it away, his desire only
      to see her grew stronger day by day. He had no fear. He longed to test
      himself. He was sure that he would be impassive, and be all the stronger
      for the test. He was more devoted than ever in his Work. He was more
      severe with himself, more charitable to others, and he could not doubt
      that he was gaining a hold-yes, a real hold-upon the lives of many about
      him. The attendance was better at the chapel; more of the penitent and
      forlorn came to him for help. And how alone he was! My God, never even to
      see her!
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Ruth Leigh was avoiding him. It was partly from a womanly reserve&mdash;called
      into expression in this form for the first time&mdash;and partly from a
      wish to spare him pain. She had been under no illusion from the first
      about the hopelessness of the attachment. She comprehended his character
      so thoroughly that she knew that for him any fall from his ideal would
      mean his ruin. He was one of the rare spirits of faith astray in a
      skeptical age. For a time she had studied curiously his efforts to adapt
      himself to his surroundings. One of these was joining a Knights of Labor
      lodge. Another was his approach to the ethical-culture movement of some of
      the leaders in the Neighborhood Guild. Another was his interest in the
      philanthropic work of agnostics like herself. She could see that he,
      burning with zeal to save the souls of men, and believing that there was
      no hope for the world except in the renunciation of the world,
      instinctively shrank from these contacts, which, nevertheless, he sought
      in the spirit of a Jesuit missionary to a barbarous tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible for such a man to be for a time overmastered by human
      passion; it was possible even that he might reason himself temporarily
      into conduct that this natural passion seemed to justify; yet she never
      doubted that there would follow an awakening from that state of mind as
      from a horrible delusion. It was simply because Ruth Leigh was guided by
      the exercise of reason, and had built up her scheme of life upon facts
      that she believed she could demonstrate, that she saw so clearly their
      relations, and felt that the faith, which was to her only a vagary of the
      material brain, was to him an integral part of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love, to be sure, was as unexpected in her scheme of life as it was in
      his; but there was on her part no reason why she should not yield to it.
      There was every reason in her nature and in her theory why she should,
      for, bounded as her vision of life was by this existence, love was the
      highest conceivable good in life. It had been with a great shout of joy
      that the consciousness had come to her that she loved and was loved.
      Though she might never see him again, this supreme experience for man or
      woman, this unsealing of the sacred fountain of life, would be for her an
      enduring sweetness in her lonely and laborious pilgrimage. How strong love
      is they best know to whom it is offered and denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why, so far as she was concerned, should she deny it? An ordinary
      woman probably would not. Love is reason enough. Why should artificial
      conventions defeat it? Why should she sacrifice herself, if he were
      willing to brave the opinion of the world for her sake? Was it any new
      thing for good men to do this? But Ruth Leigh was not an ordinary woman.
      Perhaps if her intellect had not been so long dominant over her heart it
      would have been different. But the habit of being guided by reason was
      second nature. She knew that not only his vow, but the habit of life
      engendered by the vow, was an insuperable barrier. And besides, and this
      was the touchstone of her conception of life and duty, she felt that if he
      were to break his vow, though she might love him, her respect for him
      would be impaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a singular phenomenon&mdash;very much remarked at the time&mdash;that
      the women who did not in the least share Father Damon&rsquo;s spiritual faith,
      and would have called themselves in contradistinction materialists, were
      those who admired him most, were in a way his followers, loved to attend
      his services, were inspired by his personality, and drawn to him in a
      loving loyalty. The attraction to these very women was his unworldliness,
      his separateness, his devotion to an ideal which in their reason seemed a
      delusion. And no women would have been more sensitive than they to his
      fall from his spiritual pinnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy with a little contrivance to avoid meeting him. She did not go
      to the chapel or in its neighborhood when he was likely to be going to or
      from service. She let others send for him when in her calls his
      ministration was required, and she was careful not to linger where he was
      likely to come. A little change in the time of her rounds was made without
      neglecting her work, for that she would not do, and she trusted that if
      accident threw him in her way, circumstances would make it natural and not
      embarrassing. And yet his image was never long absent from her thoughts;
      she wondered if he were dejected, if he were ill, if he were lonely, and
      mostly there was for him a great pity in her heart, a pity born, alas! of
      her own sense of loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much she was repressing her own emotions she knew one evening when she
      returned from her visits and found a letter in his handwriting. The sight
      of it was a momentary rapture, and then the expectation of what it might
      contain gave her a feeling of faintness. The letter was long. Its coming
      needs a word of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon had begun to use the Margaret Fund. He found that its
      judicious use was more perplexing than he had supposed. He needed advice,
      the advice of those who had more knowledge than he had of the merits of
      relief cases. And then there might be many sufferers whom he in his
      limited field neglected. It occurred to him that Dr. Leigh would be a most
      helpful co-almoner. No sooner did this idea come to him than he was
      spurred to put it into effect. This common labor would be a sort of bond
      between them, a bond of charity purified from all personal alloy. He went
      at once to Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s office and told him his difficulties, and about
      Dr. Leigh&rsquo;s work, and the opportunities she would have. Would it not be
      possible for Dr. Leigh to draw from the fund on her own checks independent
      of him? Mr. Henderson thought not. Dr. Leigh was no doubt a good woman,
      but he didn&rsquo;t know much about woman visitors and that sort; their
      sympathies were apt to run away with them, and he should prefer at present
      to have the fund wholly under Father Damon&rsquo;s control. Some time, he
      intimated, he might make more lasting provisions with trustees. It would
      be better for Father Damon to give Dr. Leigh money as he saw she needed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter recited this at length; it had a check endorsed, and the writer
      asked the doctor to be his almoner. He dwelt very much upon the relief
      this would be to him, and the opportunity it would give her in many
      emergencies, and the absolute confidence he had in her discretion, as well
      as in her quick sympathy with the suffering about them. And also it would
      be a great satisfaction to him to feel that he was associated with her in
      such a work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its length, in its tone of kindliness, of personal confidence,
      especially in its length, it was evident that the writing of it had been a
      pleasure, if not a relief, to the sender. Ruth read it and reread it. It
      was as if Father Damon were there speaking to her. She could hear the
      tones of his voice. And the glance of love&mdash;that last overmastering
      appeal and cry thrilled through her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the letter there was no love; to any third person it would have
      read like an ordinary friendly philanthropic request. And her reply,
      accepting gratefully his trust, was almost formal, only the writer felt
      that she was writing out of her heart.

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Roman poet Martial reckons among the elements of a happy life &ldquo;an
      income left, not earned by toil,&rdquo; and also &ldquo;a wife discreet, yet blythe
      and bright.&rdquo; Felicity in the possession of these, the epigrammatist might
      have added, depends upon content in the one and full appreciation of the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Delancy returned from Washington more discontented than when he went.
      His speculation hung fire in a most tantalizing way; more than that, it
      had absorbed nearly all the &ldquo;income not earned by toil,&rdquo; which was at the
      hazard of operations he could neither control nor comprehend. And besides,
      this little fortune had come to seem contemptibly inadequate. In his
      associations of the past year his spendthrift habits had increased, and he
      had been humiliated by his inability to keep pace with the prodigality of
      those with whom he was most intimate. Miss Tavish was an heiress in her
      own right, who never seemed to give a thought to the cost of anything she
      desired; the Hendersons, for any whim, drew upon a reservoir of unknown
      capacity; and even Mavick began to talk as if he owned a flock of geese
      that laid golden eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, it was pleasant coming home into an atmosphere of sincerity,
      of worship&mdash;was it not? It was very flattering to his self-esteem.
      The master had come! The house was in commotion. Edith flew to meet him,
      hugged him, shook him, criticised his appearance, rallied him for a
      recreant father. How well she looked-buoyant, full of vivacity, running
      over with joy, asking a dozen questions before he could answer one,
      testifying her delight, her affection, in a hundred ways. And the boy! He
      was so eager to see his papa. He could converse now&mdash;that is, in his
      way. And that prodigy, when Jack was dragged into his presence, and also
      fell down with Edith and worshiped him in his crib, did actually smile,
      and appear to know that this man belonged to him, was a part of his
      worldly possessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Edith, looking at the boy critically, &ldquo;I think of
      making Fletcher a present, if you approve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll want some place to go to in the summer. I want to buy that old
      place where he was born and give it to him. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a
      good investment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, permanent,&rdquo; replied Jack, laughing at such a mite of a real-estate
      owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he would like it. And you don&rsquo;t object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. It&rsquo;s next to an ancestral feeling to be the father of a
      land-owner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were standing close to the crib, his arm resting lightly across her
      shoulders. He drew her closer to him, and kissed her tenderly. &ldquo;The little
      chap has a golden-hearted mother. I don&rsquo;t know why he should not have a
      Golden House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes filled with sudden tears. She could not speak. But both arms were
      clasped round his neck now. She was too happy for words. And the baby,
      looking on with large eyes, seemed to find nothing unusual in the
      proceeding. He was used to a great deal of this sort of nonsense himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a happy evening. In truth, after the first surprise, Jack was
      pleased with this contemplated purchase. It was something removed beyond
      temptation. Edith&rsquo;s property was secure to her, and it was his honorable
      purpose never to draw it into his risks. But he knew her generosity, and
      he could not answer for himself if she should offer it, as he was sure she
      would do, to save him from ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was all the news to tell, the harmless gossip of daily life, which
      Edith had a rare faculty of making dramatically entertaining, with her
      insight and her feeling for comedy. There had been a musicale at the
      Blunts&rsquo;&mdash;oh, strictly amateur&mdash;and Edith ran to the piano and
      imitated the singers and took off the players, until Jack declared that it
      beat the Conventional Club out of sight. And she had been to a parlor
      mind-cure lecture, and to a Theosophic conversation, and to a Reading Club
      for the Cultivation of a Feeling for Nature through Poetry. It was all
      immensely solemn and earnest. And Jack wondered that the managers did not
      get hold of these things and put them on the stage. Nothing could draw
      like them. Not burlesques, though, said Edith; not in the least. If only
      these circles would perform in public as they did in private, how they
      would draw!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Father Damon had been to consult her about his fund. He had been
      ill, and would not stay, and seemed more severe and ascetic than ever. She
      was sure something was wrong. For Dr. Leigh, whom she had sought out
      several times, was reserved, and did not voluntarily speak of Father
      Damon; she had heard that he was throwing himself with more than his usual
      fervor into his work. There was plenty to talk about. The purchase of the
      farm by the sea had better not be delayed; Jack might have to go down and
      see the owner. Yes, he would make it his first business in the morning.
      Perhaps it would be best to get some Long-Islander to buy it for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it was ten o&rsquo;clock, Jack said he thought he would step down to
      the Union a moment. Edith&rsquo;s countenance fell. There might be letters, he
      explained, and he had a little matter of business; he wouldn&rsquo;t be late.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very agreeable, home was, and Edith was charming. He could
      distinctly feel that she was charming. But Jack was restless. He felt the
      need of talking with somebody about what was on his mind. If only with
      Major Fairfax. He would not consult the Major, but the latter was in the
      way of picking up all sorts of gossip, both social and Street gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Major was willing to unpack his budget. It was not very
      reassuring, what he had to tell; in fact, it was somewhat depressing, the
      general tightness and the panicky uncertainty, until, after a couple of
      glasses of Scotch, the financial world began to open a little and seem
      more hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Hendersons are going to build,&rdquo; Jack said at length, after a remark
      of the Major&rsquo;s about that famous operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Build? What for? They&rsquo;ve got a palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carmen says it&rsquo;s for an object-lesson. To show New York millionaires how
      to adorn their city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like that little schemer. What does Henderson say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He appears to be willing. I can&rsquo;t get the hang of Henderson. He doesn&rsquo;t
      seem to care what his wife does. He&rsquo;s a cynical cuss. The other night, at
      dinner, in Washington, when the thing was talked over, he said: &lsquo;My dear,
      I don&rsquo;t know why you shouldn&rsquo;t do that as well as anything. Let&rsquo;s build a
      house of gold, as Nero did; we are in the Roman age.&rsquo; Carmen looked
      dubious for a moment, but she said, &lsquo;You know, Rodney, that you always
      used to say that some time you would show New York what a house ought to
      be in this climate.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, go on,&rsquo; and he laughed. &lsquo;I suppose lightning
      will not strike that sooner than anything else.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said the
      Major, reflectively, reaching out his hand for the brown mug, &ldquo;the way he
      gives that woman her head, and doesn&rsquo;t care what she does, he must have a
      contempt for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish somebody had that sort of contempt for me,&rdquo; said Jack, filling up
      his glass also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, I tell you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;Mrs. Henderson has caught on to the new
      notions. Her idea is the union of all the arts. She has already got the
      refusal of a square &lsquo;way up-town, on the rise opposite the Park, and has
      been consulting architects about it. It is to be surrounded with the
      building, with a garden in the interior, a tropical garden, under glass in
      the winter. The facades are to be gorgeous and monumental. Artists and
      sculptors are to decorate it, inside and out. Why shouldn&rsquo;t there be color
      on the exterior, gold and painting, like the Fugger palaces in Augsburg,
      only on a great scale? The artists don&rsquo;t see any reason why there should
      not. It will make the city brilliant, that sort of thing, in place of our
      monotonous stone lanes. And it&rsquo;s using her wealth for the public
      benefit-the architects and artists all say that. Gad, I don&rsquo;t know but the
      little woman is beginning to regard herself as a public benefactor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is that or nothing,&rdquo; echoed the Major, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; continued Jack, confidentially, &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s got the
      right idea. If I have any luck&mdash;of course I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t do that&mdash;but
      if I have any luck, I mean to build a house that&rsquo;s got some life in it&mdash;color,
      old boy&mdash;something unique and stunning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you will,&rdquo; cried the Major, enthusiastically, and, raising his glass,
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the house that Jack built!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was later than he thought it would be when he went home, but Jack was
      attended all the way by a vision of a Golden House&mdash;all gold wouldn&rsquo;t
      be too good, and he will build it, damme, for Edith and the boy. The next
      morning not even the foundations of this structure were visible. The
      master of the house came down to a late breakfast, out of sorts with life,
      almost surly. Not even Edith&rsquo;s bright face and fresh toilet and radiant
      welcome appealed to him. No one would have thought from her appearance
      that she had waited for him last night hour after hour, and had at last
      gone to bed with a heavy heart, and not to sleep-to toss, and listen, and
      suffer a thousand tortures of suspense. How many tragedies of this sort
      are there nightly in the metropolis, none the less tragic because they are
      subjects of jest in the comic papers and on the stage! What would be the
      condition of social life if women ceased to be anxious in this regard, and
      let loose the reins in an easy-going indifference? What, in fact, is the
      condition in those households where the wives do not care? One can even
      perceive a tender sort of loyalty to women in the ejaculation of that
      battered old veteran, the Major, &ldquo;Thank God, there&rsquo;s nobody sitting up for
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack was not consciously rude. He even asked about the baby. And he sipped
      his coffee and glanced over the morning journal, and he referred to the
      conversation of the night before, and said that he would look after the
      purchase at once. If Edith had put on an aspect of injury, and had
      intimated that she had hoped that his first evening at home might have
      been devoted to her and the boy, there might have been a scene, for Jack
      needed only an occasion to vent his discontent. And for the chronicler of
      social life a scene is so much easier to deal with, an outburst of temper
      and sharp language, of accusation and recrimination, than the well-bred
      commonplace of an undefined estrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet estrangement is almost too strong a word to use in Jack&rsquo;s case. He
      would have been the first to resent it. But the truth was that Edith, in
      the life he was leading, was a rebuke to him; her very purity and
      unworldliness were out of accord with his associations, with his ventures,
      with his dissipations in that smart and glittering circle where he was
      more welcome the more he lowered his moral standards. Could he help it if
      after the first hours of his return he felt the restraint of his home, and
      that the life seemed a little flat? Almost unconsciously to himself, his
      interests and his inclinations were elsewhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Edith, with the divination of a woman, felt this. Last night her love
      alone seemed strong enough to hold him, to bring him back to the purposes
      and the aspirations that only last summer had appeared to transform him.
      Now he was slipping away again. How pitiful it is, this contest of a woman
      who has only her own love, her own virtue, with the world and its
      allurements and seductions, for the possession of her husband&rsquo;s heart! How
      powerless she is against these subtle invitations, these unknown and
      all-encompassing temptations! At times the whole drift of life, of the
      easy morality of the time, is against her. The current is so strong that
      no wonder she is often swept away in it. And what could an impartial
      observer of things as they are say otherwise than that John Delancy was
      leading the common life of his kind and his time, and that Edith was only
      bringing trouble on herself by being out of sympathy with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      He might not be in at luncheon, he said, when he was prepared to go
      down-town. He seldom was. He called at his broker&rsquo;s. Still suspense. He
      wrote to the Long Island farmer. At the Union he found a scented note from
      Carmen. They had all returned from the capital. How rejoiced she was to be
      at home! And she was dying to see him; no, not dying, but very much
      living; and it was very important. She should expect him at the usual
      hour. And could he guess what gown she would wear?
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jack went. What hold had this woman on him? Undoubtedly she had
      fascinations, but he knew&mdash;knew well enough by this time&mdash;that
      her friendship was based wholly on calculation. And yet what a sympathetic
      comrade she could be! How freely he could talk with her; there was no
      subject she did not adapt herself to. No doubt it was this adaptability
      that made her such a favorite. She did not demand too much virtue or
      require too much conventionality. The hours he was with her he was wholly
      at his ease. She made him satisfied with himself, and she didn&rsquo;t disturb
      his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Jack&mdash;he was holding both her hands with a swinging
      motion&mdash;when she came forward to greet him, and looking at her
      critically&mdash;&ldquo;I think I like you better in New York than in
      Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because you see more of me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I saw you enough in Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was my public manner. I have to live up to Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s
      reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here you only have to live up to mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can live for my friends,&rdquo; she replied, with an air of candor, giving a
      very perceptible pressure with her little hands. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack kissed each little hand before he let it drop, and looked as if he
      believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how does the house get on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Famously. The lot is bought. Mr. Van Brunt was here all the morning. It&rsquo;s
      going to be something Oriental, mediaeval, nineteenth-century, gorgeous,
      and domestic. Van Brunt says he wants it to represent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Jack; &ldquo;all the four facades different?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With an interior unity&mdash;all the styles brought to express an
      individual taste, don&rsquo;t you know. A different house from the four sides of
      approach, and inside, home&mdash;that&rsquo;s the idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me,&rdquo; said Jack, still bantering, &ldquo;that it will look like an
      apartment-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what it will not&mdash;that is, outside unity, and inside a
      menagerie. This won&rsquo;t look gregarious. It is to have not more than three
      stories, perhaps only two. And then exterior color, decoration, statuary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And gold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too much&mdash;not to give it a cheap gilded look. Oh, I asked him
      about Nero&rsquo;s house. As I remember it, that was mostly caverns. Mr. Van
      Brunt laughed, and said they were not going to excavate this house. The
      Roman notion was barbarous grandeur. But in point of beauty and luxury,
      this would be as much superior to Nero&rsquo;s house as the electric light is to
      a Roman lamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not classic, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, all that&rsquo;s good in classic form, with the modern spirit. You ought
      to hear Mr. Van Brunt talk. This country has never yet expressed itself in
      domestic inhabitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to cost! What does Mr. Henderson say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he rather likes it. He told Mr. Van Brunt to consult me and go
      ahead with his plans. But he talks queerly. He said he thought he would
      have money enough at least for the foundation. Do you think, Jack,&rdquo; asked
      Carmen, with a sudden change of manner, &ldquo;that Mr. Henderson is really the
      richest man in the United States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people say so. Really, I don&rsquo;t know how any one can tell. If he let
      go his hand from his affairs, I don&rsquo;t know what a panic would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen looked thoughtful. &ldquo;He said to me once that he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the
      Street any more. I told him this morning that I didn&rsquo;t want to begin this
      if it was going to incommode him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was just going out. He looked at me a moment with that speculative
      sort of look-no, it isn&rsquo;t cynical, as you say; I know it so well&mdash;and
      then said: &lsquo;Oh, go ahead. I guess it will be all right. If anything
      happens, you can turn it into a boardinghouse. It will be an excellent
      sanitarium.&rsquo; That was all. Anyway, it&rsquo;s something to do. Come, let&rsquo;s go
      and see the place.&rdquo; And she started up and touched the bell for the
      carriage. It was more than something to do. In those days before her
      marriage, when her mother was living, and when they wandered about Europe,
      dangerously near to the reputation of adventuresses, the girl had her
      dream of chateaux and castles and splendor. Her chance did not come in
      Europe, but, as she would have said, Providence is good to those who wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Jack went to Long Island, and the farm was bought, and the
      deed brought to Edith, who, with much formality, presented it to the boy,
      and that young gentleman showed his appreciation of it by trying to eat
      it. It would have seemed a pretty incident to Jack, if he had not been
      absorbed in more important things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was very much absorbed, and apparently more idle than ever. As the
      days went on, and the weeks, he was less and less at home, and in a worse
      humor&mdash;that is, at home. Carmen did not find him ill-humored, nor was
      there any change towards the fellows at the Union, except that it was
      noticed that he had his cross days. There was nothing specially to
      distinguish him from a dozen others, who led the same life of vacuity, of
      mild dissipation, of enforced pleasure. A wager now and then on an
      &ldquo;event&rdquo;; a fictitious interest in elections; lively partisanship in
      society scandals: Not much else. The theatres were stale, and only
      endurable on account of the little suppers afterwards; and really there
      wasn&rsquo;t much in life except the women who made it agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Fairfax was not a model; there had not much survived out of his
      checkered chances and experiences, except a certain instinct of being a
      gentleman, sir; the close of his life was not exactly a desirable goal;
      but even the Major shook his head over Jack.

      XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The one fact in which men universally agree is that we come into the world
      alone and we go out of the world alone; and although we travel in company,
      make our pilgrimage to Canterbury or to Vanity Fair in a great show of
      fellowship, and of bearing one another&rsquo;s burdens, we carry our deepest
      troubles alone. When we think of it, it is an awful lonesomeness in this
      animated and moving crowd. Each one either must or will carry his own
      burden, which he commonly cannot, or by pride or shame will not, ask help
      in carrying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson drew more and more apart from confidences, and was alone in
      building up the colossal structure of his wealth. Father Damon was
      carrying his renewed temptation alone, after all his brave confession and
      attempt at renunciation. Ruth Leigh plodded along alone, with her secret
      which was the joy and the despair of her life&mdash;the opening of a gate
      into the paradise which she could never enter. Jack Delancy, the
      confiding, open-hearted good fellow, had come to a stage in his journey
      where he also was alone. Not even to Carmen could he confess the extent of
      his embarrassments, nor even in her company, nor in the distraction of his
      increasingly dissipated life, could he forget them. Not only had his
      investments been all transferred to his speculations, but his home had
      been mortgaged, and he did not dare tell Edith of the lowering cloud that
      hung over it; and that his sole dependence was the confidence of the
      Street, which any rumor might shatter, in that one of Henderson&rsquo;s schemes
      to which he had committed himself. Edith, the one person who could have
      comforted him, was the last person to whom he could have told this, for he
      had the most elementary, and the common conception of what marriage is.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Edith&rsquo;s lot was the most pitiful of all. She was not only alone, but
      compelled to inaction. She saw the fair fabric of her life dissolving, and
      neither by cries nor tears, by appeals nor protest, by show of anger nor
      by show of suffering, could she hinder the dissolution. Strong in herself
      and full of courage, day by day and week by week she felt her
      powerlessness. Heaven knows what it cost her&mdash;what it costs all women
      in like circumstances&mdash;to be always cheerful, never to show distrust.
      If her love were not enough, if her attractions were not enough, there was
      no human help to which she could appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what, pray, was there to appeal? There was no visible neglect, no
      sufficient alienation for gossip to take hold of. If there was a little
      talk about Jack&rsquo;s intimacy elsewhere, was there anything uncommon in that?
      Affairs went on as usual. Was it reasonable to suppose that society should
      notice that one woman&rsquo;s heart was full of foreboding, heavy with a sense
      of loss and defeat, and with the ruin of two lives? Could simple misery
      like this rise to the dignity of tragedy in a world that has its share of
      tragedies, shocking and violent, but is on the whole going on decorously
      and prosperously?

    <p>
      The season wore on. It was the latter part of May. Jack had taken Edith
      and the boy down to the Long Island house, and had returned to the city
      and was living at his club, feverishly waiting for some change in his
      affairs. It was a sufficient explanation of his anxiety that money was
      &ldquo;tight,&rdquo; that failures were daily announced, and that there was a general
      fear of worse times. It was fortunate for Jack and other speculators that
      they could attribute their ill-luck to the general financial condition.
      There were reasons enough for this condition. Some attributed it to want
      of confidence, others to the tariff, others to the action of this or that
      political party, others to over-production, others to silver, others to
      the action of English capitalists in withdrawing their investments. It
      could all be accounted for without referring to the fact that most of the
      individual sufferers, like Jack, owed more than they could pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was much of the time absent&mdash;at the West and at the South.
      His every move was watched, his least sayings were reported as
      significant, and the Street was hopeful or depressed as he seemed to be
      cheerful or unusually taciturn. Uncle Jerry was the calmest man in town,
      and his observation that Henderson knew what he was about was reassuring.
      His serenity was well founded. The fact was that he had been pulling in
      and lowering canvas for months. Or, as he put it, he hadn&rsquo;t much hay
      out... &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never a good plan,&rdquo; said Uncle Jerry, &ldquo;to put off raking up
      till the shower begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems absurd to speak of the East Side in connection with the financial
      situation. But that was where the pinch was felt, and felt first. Work was
      slack, and that meant actual hunger for many families. The monetary
      solidarity of the town is remarkable. No one flies a kite in Wall Street
      that somebody in Rivington Street does not in consequence have to go
      without his dinner. As Dr. Leigh went her daily rounds she encountered
      painful evidence of the financial disturbance. Increased number of cases
      for the doctor followed want of sufficient food and the eating of cheap,
      unwholesome food. She was often obliged to draw upon the Margaret Fund,
      and to invoke the aid of Father Damon when the responsibility was too
      great for her. And Father Damon found that his ministry was daily diverted
      from the cure of souls to the care of bodies. Among all those who came to
      the mission as a place of refuge and rest, and to whom the priest sought
      to offer the consolations of religion and of his personal sympathy, there
      were few who did not have a tale of suffering to tell that wrung his
      heart. Some of them were actually ill, or had at home a sick husband or a
      sick daughter. And such cases had to be reported to Dr. Leigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became necessary, therefore, that these two, who had shunned each other
      for months, should meet as often as they had done formerly. This was very
      hard for both, for it meant only the renewal of heart-break, regret, and
      despair. And yet it had been almost worse when they did not see each
      other. They met; they talked of nothing but their work; they tried to
      forget themselves in their devotion to humanity. But the human heart will
      not be thus disposed of. It was impossible that some show of personal
      interest, some tenderness, should not appear. They were walking towards
      Fourth Avenue one evening&mdash;the priest could not resist the impulse to
      accompany her a little way towards her home&mdash;after a day of unusual
      labor and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are working too hard,&rdquo; he said, gently; &ldquo;you look fatigued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; she replied, looking up cheerfully; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a regular machine. I get
      run down, and then I wind up. I get tired, and then I get rested. It isn&rsquo;t
      the work,&rdquo; she added, after a moment, &ldquo;if only I could see any good of it.
      It seems so hopeless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your point of view, my dear doctor,&rdquo; he answered, but without any
      shade of reproof in his tone. &ldquo;But no good deed is lost. There is nothing
      else in the world&mdash;nothing for me.&rdquo; The close of the sentence seemed
      wholly accidental, and he stopped speaking as if he could not trust
      himself to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth Leigh looked up quickly. &ldquo;But, Father Damon, it is you who ought to
      be rebuked for overwork. You are undertaking too much. You ought to go off
      for a vacation, and go at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The father looked paler and thinner than usual, but his mouth was set in
      firm lines, and he said: &ldquo;It cannot be. My duty is here. And&rdquo;&mdash;he
      turned, and looked her full in the face&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No need to explain that simple word. No need to interpret the swift glance
      that their eyes exchanged&mdash;the eager, the pitiful glance. They both
      knew. It was not the work. It was not the suffering of the world. It was
      the pain in their own hearts, and the awful chasm that his holy vows had
      put between them. They stood so only an instant. He was trembling in the
      extort to master himself, and in a second she felt the hot blood rising to
      her face. Her woman&rsquo;s wit was the first to break the hopeless situation.
      She turned, and hailed a passing car. &ldquo;I cannot walk any farther.
      Good-night.&rdquo; And she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest stood as if a sudden blow had struck him, following the
      retreating car till it was out of sight, and then turned homeward, dazed,
      and with feeble steps. What was this that had come to him to so shake his
      life? What devil was tempting him to break his vows and forsake his faith?
      Should he fly from the city and from his work, or should he face what
      seemed to him, in the light of his consecration, a monstrous temptation,
      and try to conquer himself? He began to doubt his power to do this. He had
      always believed that it was easy to conquer nature. And now a little brown
      woman had taught him that he reckons ill who leaves out the strongest
      human passion. And yet suppose he should break his solemn vows and throw
      away his ideal, and marry Ruth Leigh, would he ever be happy? Here was a
      mediaeval survival confronted by a nineteenth-century skepticism. The
      situation was plainly insoluble. It was as plainly so to the clear mind of
      the unselfish little woman without faith as it was to him. Perhaps she
      could not have respected him if he had yielded. Strangely enough, the
      attraction of the priest for her and for other women who called themselves
      servants of humanity was in his consecration, in his attitude of
      separation from the vanities and passions of this world. They believed in
      him, though they did not share his faith. To Ruth Leigh this experience of
      love was as unexpected as it was to the priest. Perhaps because her life
      was lived on a less exalted plane she could bear it with more equanimity.
      But who knows? The habit of her life was endurance, the sturdy meeting of
      the duty of every day, with at least only a calm regard of the future. And
      she would go on. But who can measure the inner change in her life? She
      must certainly be changed by this deep experience, and, terrible as it
      was, perhaps ennobled by it. Is there not something supernatural in such a
      love itself? It has a wonderful transforming power. It is certain that a
      new light, a tender light, was cast upon her world. And who can say that
      some time, in the waiting and working future, this new light might not
      change life altogether for this faithful soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one person upon whom the tragedy of life thus far sat lightly.
      Even her enemies, if she had any, would not deny that Carmen had an
      admirable temperament. If she had been a Moslem, it might be predicted
      that she would walk the wire &lsquo;El Serat&rsquo; without a tremor. In these days
      she was busy with the plans of her new house. The project suited her
      ambition and her taste. The structure grew in her mind into barbaric
      splendor, but a barbaric splendor refined, which reveled in the exquisite
      adornment of the Alhambra itself. She was in daily conferences with her
      architect and her artists, she constantly consulted Jack about it, and
      Mavick whenever he was in town, and occasionally she awakened the interest
      of Henderson himself, who put no check upon her proceedings, although his
      mind was concerned with a vaster structure of his own. She talked of
      little else, until in her small world there grew up a vast expectation of
      magnificence, of which hints appeared from time to time in the newspapers,
      mysterious allusions to Roman luxury, to Nero and his Golden House.
      Henderson read these paragraphs, as he read the paragraphs about his own
      fortune, with a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your house is getting a lot of free advertising,&rdquo; he said to Carmen one
      evening after dinner in the library, throwing the newspaper on the table
      as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They all seem to like the idea,&rdquo; replied Carmen. &ldquo;Did you see what one of
      the papers said about the use of wealth in adorning the city? That&rsquo;s my
      notion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Henderson, with a smile, &ldquo;that you put that notion into
      the reporter&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he thought he suggested it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look over the last drawing.&rdquo; Henderson half rose from his chair to
      pull the sheet towards him, but instantly sank back, and put his hand to
      his heart. Carmen saw that he was very pale, and ran round to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he said, taking a long breath. &ldquo;Just a stitch. Indigestion. It
      must have been the coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen ran to the dining-room, and returned with a wineglass of brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, take that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drank it. &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s better. I&rsquo;m all right now.&rdquo; And he sat still,
      slowly recovering color and control of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to send for the doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; nonsense. It has all passed,&rdquo; and he stretched out his arms and
      threw them back vigorously. &ldquo;It was only a moment&rsquo;s faintness. It&rsquo;s quite
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his chair and took a turn or two about the room. Yes, he was
      quite himself, and he patted Carmen&rsquo;s head as he passed and took his seat
      again. For a moment or two there was silence. Then he said, still as if
      reflecting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer? In that moment of faintness all my life flashed through
      my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been a very successful life,&rdquo; Carmen said, by way of saying
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; but I wonder if it was worth while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a man, I should enjoy the power you have, the ability to do
      what you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I do. That is all there is. I like to conquer obstacles, and I
      like to command. And money; I never did care for money in itself. But
      there is a fascination in building up a great fortune. It is like
      conducting a political or a military campaign. Now, I haven&rsquo;t much
      interest in anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he looked round upon the crowded shelves of his library, and,
      getting up, went to the corner where there was a shelf of rare editions
      and took down a volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember when I got this, Carmen? It was when I was a bachelor. It
      was rare then. I saw it quoted the other day as worth twice the price I
      gave for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replaced it carefully, and walked along the shelves looking at the
      familiar titles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to read then. And you read still; you have time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not those books,&rdquo; she replied, with a laugh. &ldquo;Those belong to the last
      generation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is where I belong,&rdquo; he said, smiling also. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have
      read a book, not really read it, in ten years. This modern stuff that
      pretends to give life is so much less exciting than my own daily
      experience that I cannot get interested in it. Perhaps I could read these
      calm old books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the newspapers that take your time,&rdquo; Carmen suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they pass the time when I am thinking. And they are full of
      suggestions. I suppose they are as accurate about other things as about
      me. I used to think I would make this library the choicest in the city. It
      is good as far as it goes. Perhaps I will take it up some day&mdash;if I
      live.&rdquo; And he turned away from the shelves and sat down. Carmen had never
      seen him exactly in this humor and was almost subdued by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to talk again, philosophizing about life generally and his own
      life. He seemed to like to recall his career, and finally said: &ldquo;Uncle
      Jerry is successful too, and he never did care for anything else&mdash;except
      his family. There is a clerk in my office on five thousand a year who is
      never without a book when he comes to the office and when I see him on the
      train. He has a wife and a nice little family in Jersey. I ask him
      sometimes about his reading. He is collecting a library, but not of rare
      books; says he cannot afford that. I think he is successful too, or will
      be if he never gets more than five thousand a year, and is content with
      his books and his little daily life, coming and going to his family. Ah,
      well! Everybody must live his life. I suppose there is some explanation of
      it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything gone wrong?&rdquo; asked Carmen, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all. Nothing to interfere with the house of gold.&rdquo; He spoke
      quite gently and sincerely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what set me into this
      moralizing. Let&rsquo;s look at the plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day&mdash;it was the first of June&mdash;in consultation with the
      architect, a project was broached that involved such an addition of cost
      that Carmen hesitated. She declared that it was a question of ways and
      means, and that she must consult the chairman. Accordingly she called her
      carriage and drove down to Henderson&rsquo;s office.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful day, a little warm in the narrow streets of the lower
      city, but when she had ascended by the elevator to the high story that
      Henderson occupied in one of the big buildings that rise high enough to
      give a view of New York Harbor, and looked from the broad windows upon one
      of the most sparkling and animated scenes in the world, it seemed to her
      appreciative eyes a day let down out of Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerks all knew Mrs. Henderson, and they rose and bowed as she tripped
      along smiling towards her husband&rsquo;s rooms. It did not seem to be a very
      busy day, and she found no one waiting in the anteroom, and passed into
      the room of his private secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Henderson in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably busy,&rdquo; replied the secretary, with a smile, &ldquo;but he is alone. No
      one has disturbed him for over half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tapped lightly at the door. There was no response. She turned the knob
      softly and looked in, and then, glancing back at the secretary, with a
      finger uplifted, &ldquo;I think he is asleep,&rdquo; opened the door, stepped in, and
      closed it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large room was full of light, and through the half-dozen windows burst
      upon her the enchanting scene of the Bay, Henderson sat at his table,
      which was covered with neatly arranged legal documents, but bowed over it,
      his head resting upon his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, Rodney, this is the way, old boy, that you wear yourself out in
      business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke laughingly, but he did not stir, and she tiptoed along to awaken
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his hand. It moved heavily away from her hand. The left arm,
      released, dropped at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started back, her eyes round with terror, and screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the secretary was at her side, and supported her, fainting, to a
      seat. Other clerks rushed in at the alarm. Henderson was lifted from his
      chair and laid upon a lounge. When the doctor who had been called arrived,
      Carmen was in a heap by the low couch, one arm thrown across the body, and
      her head buried in the cushion close to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor instantly applied restoratives; he sent for an electric
      battery; everything was done that science could suggest. But all was of no
      avail. There was no sign of life. He must have been dead half an hour,
      said the doctor. It was evidently heart-failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the doctor had pronounced his verdict there was a whisper in the
      Stock Exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henderson is dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not possible,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him only yesterday,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in his office this morning,&rdquo; said a third. &ldquo;I never saw him looking
      in better health.&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0337}.jpg" alt="{0337}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0337}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      The whisper was confirmed. There was no doubt of it. Henderson&rsquo;s private
      secretary had admitted it. Yet it seemed incredible. No provision had been
      made for it. Speculation had not discounted it. A panic set in. No one
      knew what to do, for no one knew well the state of Henderson&rsquo;s affairs. In
      the first thirty minutes there was a tremendous drop in Henderson stocks.
      Then some of them rallied, but before the partial recovery hundreds of men
      had been ruined. It was a wild hour in the Exchange. Certain stocks were
      hopelessly smashed for the time, and some combinations were destroyed;
      among them was one that Uncle Jerry had kept out of; and Jack Delancy was
      hopelessly ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event was flashed over the wires of the continent; it was bulletined;
      it was cried in the streets; it was the all-absorbing talk of the town.
      Already, before the dead man was removed to his own house, people were
      beginning to moralize about him and his career. Perhaps the truest thing
      was said by the old broker in the board whose reputation for piety was
      only equaled by his reputation of always having money to loan at
      exorbitant rates in a time of distress. He said to a group of downcast
      operators, &ldquo;In the midst of life we are in death.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      The place that Rodney Henderson occupied in the mind of the public was
      shown by the attention the newspapers paid to his death. All the great
      newspapers in all the cities of importance published long and minute
      biographies of him, with pictorial illustrations, and day after day
      characteristic anecdotes of his remarkable career. Nor was there, it is
      believed, a newspaper in the United States, secular, religious, or
      special, that did not comment upon his life. This was the more remarkable
      in that he was not a public man in the common use of the word: he had
      never interested himself in politics, or in public affairs, municipal or
      State or national; he had devoted himself entirely to building up his
      private fortune. If this is the duty of a citizen, he had discharged it
      with singleness of purpose; but no other duty of the citizen had he
      undertaken, if we except his private charities. And yet no public man of
      his day excited more popular interest or was the subject of more newspaper
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these comments were nearly all respectful, and most of them kindly.
      There was some justice in this, for Henderson had been doing what
      everybody else was trying to do, usually without his good-fortune. If he
      was more successful than others in trying to get rich, surely a great deal
      of admiration was mingled with the envy of his career. To be sure, some
      journals were very severe upon his methods, and some revived the old
      stories of his unscrupulousness in transactions which had laid him open to
      criminal prosecution, from the effects of which he was only saved by
      uncommon adroitness and, some said, by legal technicalities. His career
      also was denounced by some as wholly vicious in its effect upon the youth
      of the republic, and as lowering the tone of public morals. And yet it was
      remembered that he had been a frank, open-hearted friend, kind to his
      family, and generous in contrast with some of his close-fisted
      contemporaries. There was nothing mean about him; even his rascalities, if
      you chose to call his transactions by that name, were on a grand scale. To
      be sure, he would let nothing stand between him and the consummation of
      his schemes&mdash;he was like Napoleon in that&mdash;but those who knew
      him personally liked him. The building up of his colossal fortune&mdash;which
      the newspapers were saying was the largest that had been accumulated in
      one lifetime in America&mdash;had ruined thousands of people, and carried
      disaster into many peaceful houses, and his sudden death had been a
      cyclone of destruction for an hour. But it was hardly fair, one journal
      pointed out, to hold Henderson responsible for his untimely death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Jack Delancy, when the crushing news was brought him at the club,
      where he sat talking with Major Fairfax, although he saw his own ruin in a
      flash, said, &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if Henderson had lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so soon,&rdquo; replied the Major, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that Henderson and Mavick and Mrs. Henderson would
      have thrown me over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, not exactly; but a big machine grinds on regardless, and when
      the crash comes everybody looks out for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll telegraph to Mavick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t do any good now. He couldn&rsquo;t have stopped the panic. I tell
      you what, you&rsquo;d better go down to your brokers and see just how matters
      stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0343}.jpg" alt="{0343}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0343}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      And the two went down to Wall Street. It was after hours, but the brokers&rsquo;
      office was full of excitement. No one knew what was left from the storm,
      nor what to expect. It was some time before Jack could get speech with one
      of the young men of the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a&mdash;&mdash;of a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, his estate is all right, so far as we know. He was well out of the
      Missouris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Missouri?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bottom dropped out; temporarily, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my account?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wiped out, I am sorry to say. Might come up by-and-by, if you&rsquo;ve got a
      lot of money to put up, and wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all up,&rdquo; said Jack, turning to the Major. He was very pale. He
      knew now that his fortune was gone absolutely&mdash;house, everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few words were exchanged as they made their way back to the club. And here
      the Major did a most unusual thing for him. He ordered the drinks. But he
      did this delicately, apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as you care for anything, but Wall Street has made me
      thirsty. Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; Jack replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was not cheerful; it was mainly ejaculatory. After a
      second glass, Jack said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it would do any good, but I
      should like to see Mavick.&rdquo; And then, showing the drift of his thoughts,
      &ldquo;I wonder what Carmen will do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say that will depend upon the will,&rdquo; replied the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good-hearted woman,&rdquo; and Jack&rsquo;s tone was one of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t any, Jack. Not the least bit of a heart. And I believe
      Henderson found it out. I shall be surprised if his will doesn&rsquo;t show that
      he knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant came to the corner where they were sitting and handed Jack a
      telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Mavick?&rdquo; He tore it open. &ldquo;No; Edith.&rdquo; He read it with
      something like a groan, and passed it over to the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he read was this: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cast down, Jack. The boy and I are well.
      Come. Edith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is splendid; that is just like her,&rdquo; cried the Major. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be out of
      this by the first train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no use,&rdquo; replied Jack gloomily. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;face Edith now. I
      couldn&rsquo;t do it. I wonder how she knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called back the servant, and penned as reassuring a message as he
      could, but said that it was impossible to leave town. She must not worry
      about him. This despatched, they fell again into a talk about the
      situation. After another glass Jack was firm in his resolution to stay and
      watch things. It seemed not impossible that something might turn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day after, both the Major and Jack attended the funeral at
      the house. Carmen was not visible. The interment was private. The day
      following, Jack left his card of condolence at the door; but one day
      passed, and another and another, and no word of acknowledgment came from
      the stricken widow. Jack said to himself that it was not natural to expect
      it. But he did expect it, and without reason, for he should have known
      that Carmen was not only overwhelmed with the sudden shock of her
      calamity, but that she would necessarily be busy with affairs that even
      grief would not permit her to neglect. Jack heard that Mavick had been in
      the city, and that he went to the Henderson house, but he had not called
      at the club, and the visit must have been a flying one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed, and Jack received no message from Carmen. His note offering
      his services if she needed the services of any one had not been answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen was indeed occupied. It could not be otherwise. The state of
      Henderson&rsquo;s affairs could not wait upon conventionalities. The day after
      the funeral Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s private secretary came to the house, and had a
      long interview with Mrs. Henderson. He explained to her that the affairs
      should be immediately investigated, the will proved, and the estate put
      into the hands of the executors. It would be best for Mrs. Henderson
      herself to bring his keys down to the office, and to see the opening of
      his desk and boxes. Meantime it would be well for her to see if there were
      any papers of importance in the house; probably everything was in the
      office safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Carmen nerved herself to the task. With his keys in hand
      she went alone into the library and opened his writing-desk. Everything
      was in perfect order; letters and papers filed and labeled, and neatly
      arranged in drawers and pigeonholes. There lay his letter-book as he had
      last used it, and there lay fresh memoranda of his projects and
      engagements. She found in one of the drawers some letters of her own,
      mostly notes, and most of them written before her marriage. In another
      drawer were some bundles of letters, a little yellow with age, endorsed
      with the name of &ldquo;Margaret.&rdquo; She shut the drawer without looking at them.
      She continued to draw papers from the pigeon-holes and glance at them.
      Most of them related to closed transactions. At length she drew out one
      that instantly fixed her attention. It was endorsed, &ldquo;Last Will and
      Testament.&rdquo; She looked first at the date at the end&mdash;it was quite
      recent&mdash;and then leaned back in her chair and set herself
      deliberately to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document was long and full of repetitions and technicalities, but the
      purport of it was plain. As she read on she was at first astonished, then
      she was excited to trembling, and felt herself pale and faint; but when
      she had finished and fully comprehended it her pretty face was distorted
      with rage. The great bulk of the property was not for her. She sprang up
      and paced the floor. She came back and took up the document with a motion
      of tearing it in pieces. No&mdash;it would be better to burn it. Of course
      there must be another will deposited in the safe. Henderson had told her
      so. It was drawn up shortly after their marriage. It could not be worse
      for her than this. She lighted the gas-jet by the fireplace, and held the
      paper in her hand. Then a thought struck her. What if somebody knew of
      this will, and its execution could be proved! She looked again at the end.
      It was signed and sealed. There were the names of two witnesses. One was
      the name of their late butler, who had been long in Henderson&rsquo;s service,
      and who had died less than a month ago. The other name was Thomas Mavick.
      Evidently the will had been signed recently, on some occasion when Mavick
      was in the house. And Henderson&rsquo;s lawyer probably knew it also!
    </p>
    <p>
      She folded the document carefully, put it back in the pigeon-hole, locked
      the desk, and rang the bell for her carriage. She was ready when the
      carriage came to the door, and told the coachman to drive to the office of
      Mr. Sage in Nassau Street. Mr. Sage had been for many years Henderson&rsquo;s
      most confidential lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received Carmen in his private office, with the subdued respect due to
      her grief and the sudden tragedy that had overtaken her. He was a man well
      along in years, a small man, neat in his dress, a little formal and
      precise in his manner, with a smoothly shaven face and gray eyes, keen,
      but not unkindly in expression. He had the reputation, which he deserved,
      for great ability and integrity. After the first salutations and words of
      condolence were spoken, Carmen said, &ldquo;I have come to consult you, Mr.
      Sage, about my husband&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite at your service, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see you before I went to the office with the keys of his
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mr. Sage, &ldquo;I could spare you that trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; his secretary thought I had better come myself, if I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Sage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen hesitated a moment, and then said, in an inquiring tone, &ldquo;I suppose
      the first thing is the will. He told me long ago that his will was made. I
      suppose it is in the safe. Didn&rsquo;t you draw it, Mr. Sage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; the lawyer replied, leaning back in his chair, &ldquo;I drew that; a
      long time ago; shortly after your marriage. And about a year ago I drew
      another one. Did he ever speak of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Carmen replied, with a steady voice, but trembling inwardly at her
      narrow escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; continued Mr. Sage, &ldquo;if it was ever executed? He took it, and
      said he would think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Executed?&rdquo; queried Carmen, looking up. &ldquo;How do you mean, before a
      magistrate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; signed and witnessed. It is very simple. The law requires two
      witnesses; the testator and the witnesses must declare that they sign in
      the presence of each other. The witnesses prove the will, or, if they are
      dead, their signatures can be proved. I was one of the witnesses of the
      first will, and a clerk of Henderson&rsquo;s, who is still in his office, was
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last one is probably in the safe if it was executed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; the lawyer assented. &ldquo;If not, you&rsquo;d better look for it in the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Whether it exists or not, I want to carry out my husband&rsquo;s
      intention,&rdquo; Carmen said, sweetly. &ldquo;Have you any memorandum of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, somewhere, but the leading provisions are in my mind. It
      would astonish the public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Carmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the property was greater than any of us supposed, and&mdash;perhaps
      I ought not to speak to you of this now, Mrs. Henderson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have a right to know what my husband&rsquo;s last wishes were,&rdquo;
       Carmen answered, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he had a great scheme. The greater part of his property after the
      large legacies&mdash;&rdquo; The lawyer saw that Carmen looked pale, and he
      hesitated a moment, and then said, in a cheery manner: &ldquo;Oh, I assure you,
      madam, that this will gave you a great fortune; all the establishment, and
      a very great fortune. But the residue was in trust for the building and
      endowment of an Industrial School on the East Side, with a great library
      and a reading-room, all to be free. It was a great scheme, and carefully
      worked out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to know this,&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;Was there anything else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only some legacies.&rdquo; And Mr. Sage went on, trying to recall details that
      his attentive listener already knew. There were legacies to some of his
      relatives in New Hampshire, and there was a fund, quite a handsome fund,
      for the poor of the city, called the &ldquo;Margaret Fund.&rdquo; And there was
      something also for a relative of the late Mrs. Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen again expressed her desire to carry out her husband&rsquo;s wishes in
      everything, and Mr. Sage was much impressed by her sweet manner. When she
      had found out all that he knew or remembered of the new will, and arose to
      go, Mr. Sage said he would accompany her to the office. And Carmen
      gratefully accepted his escort, saying that she had wished to ask him to
      go with her, but that she feared to take up so much of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the office the first will was found, but no other. The lawyer glanced
      through it, and then handed it to Mrs. Henderson, with the remark, &ldquo;It
      leaves you, madam, pretty much everything of which he died possessed.&rdquo;
       Carmen put it aside. She did not care to read it now. She would go home
      and search for the other one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If no other is found,&rdquo; said Mr. Sage, in bidding her good-morning, &ldquo;this
      one ought to be proved tomorrow. I may tell you that you and Mr. Hollowell
      are named as executors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On her way home Carmen stopped at a telegraph station, and sent a message
      to Mavick, in Washington, to take an afternoon train and come to New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Carmen reached home she was in a serious but perfectly clear frame of
      mind. The revelation in the last will of Henderson&rsquo;s change of mind
      towards her was mortifying to a certain extent. It was true that his
      fortune was much increased since the first will was made, and that it
      justified his benevolent scheme. But he might have consulted her about it.
      If she had argued the matter with her conscience, she would have told her
      conscience that she would carry out this new plan in her own way and time.
      She was master of the situation, and saw before her a future of almost
      unlimited opportunity and splendor, except for one little obstacle. That
      obstacle was Mr. Mavick. She believed that she understood him thoroughly,
      but she could not take the next step until she had seen him. It was true
      that no one except herself positively knew that a second will now existed,
      but she did not know how much he might choose to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very impatient to see Mr. Mavick. She wandered about the house,
      restless and feverish. Presently it occurred to her that it would be best
      to take the will wholly into her own keeping. She unlocked the desk, took
      it out with a trembling hand, but did not open it again. It was not
      necessary. A first reading had burned every item of it into her brain. It
      seemed to be a sort of living thing. She despised herself for being so
      agitated, and for the furtive feeling that overcame her as she glanced
      about to be sure that she was alone, and then she ran up stairs to her
      room and locked the document in her own writing-desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that? Oh, it was only the door-bell. But who could it be? Some
      one from the office, from her lawyer? She could see nobody. In two minutes
      there was a rap at her door. It was only the servant with a despatch. She
      took it and opened it without haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Dobson; no answer. I expect Mr. Mavick on business at ten. I
      am at home to no one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock Mr. Mavick came, and was shown into the library, where
      Carmen awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very good of you to come,&rdquo; she said, as she advanced to meet him
      and gave him her hand in the natural subdued manner that the circumstances
      called for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took the first train after I received your despatch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry to inconvenience you so,&rdquo; she said, after they were seated,
      &ldquo;but you know so much of Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s affairs that your advice will be
      needed. His will is to be proved tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Mavick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to see&mdash;Mr. Sage today, and he went with me to the office.
      The will was in the safe. I did not read it, but Mr. Sage said that it
      left everything to me except a few legacies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it should be proved tomorrow, unless a later will turned up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a later will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what he did not know. He had drawn a new will about a year ago,
      but he doubted if it had ever been executed. Mr. Henderson was considering
      it. He thought he had a memorandum of it somewhere, but he remembered the
      principal features of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it a great change from the first?&rdquo; Mavick asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, considerable. In fact, the greater part of his property, as far as I
      could make out, was to go to endow a vast training-school, library, and
      reading-room on the East Side. Of course that would be a fine thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mavick. &ldquo;And no such will has been found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked everywhere,&rdquo; replied Carmen, simply; &ldquo;all over the house. It
      should be in that desk if anywhere. We can look again, but I feel pretty
      sure there is no such document there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took in her hand the bunch of keys that lay on the table, as if she
      were about to rise and unlock the desk. Then she hesitated, and looked
      Mavick full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Mavick, that will was ever executed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they looked steadily at each other, and then he said,
      deliberately, their eyes squarely meeting, &ldquo;I do not think it was.&rdquo; And in
      a moment he added, &ldquo;He never said anything to me about such a disposition
      of his property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two things were evident to Carmen from this reply. He saw her interests as
      she saw them, and it was pretty certain that the contents of the will were
      not made known to him when he witnessed it. She experienced an immense
      feeling of relief as she arose and unlocked the desk. They sat down before
      it together, and went over its contents. Mavick made a note of the fresh
      business memoranda that might be of service next day, since Mrs. Henderson
      had requested him to attend the proving of the will, and to continue for
      the present the business relations with her that he had held with Mr.
      Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when he left the house, but he took with him a note to Mr.
      Sage to drop into the box for morning delivery. The note said that she had
      searched the house, that no second will existed there, and that she had
      telegraphed to Mr. Mavick, who had much knowledge of Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s
      affairs, to meet him in the morning. And she read the note to Mavick
      before she sealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the note could have been dropped into the box, Carmen was in her
      room, and the note was literally true. No second will existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The will was proved, and on the second day its contents were in all the
      newspapers. But with it went a very exciting story. This was the rumor of
      another will, and of Henderson&rsquo;s vast scheme of benevolence. Mr. Sage had
      been interviewed and Carmen had been interviewed. The memorandum (which
      was only rough and not wholly legible notes) had been found and sent to
      Carmen. There was no concealment about it. She gave the reporters all the
      details, and to every one she said that it was her intention to carry out
      her husband&rsquo;s wishes, so far as they could be ascertained from this
      memorandum, when his affairs had been settled. The thirst of the reporters
      for information amused even Carmen, who had seen much of this industrious
      tribe. One of them, to whom she had partially explained the situation,
      ended by asking her, &ldquo;Are you going to contest the will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Contest the will?&rdquo; cried Carmen. &ldquo;There is nothing to contest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the young man, whose usual occupation was reporting
      sports, and who had a dim idea that every big will must be contested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Necessarily the affair made a great deal of talk. The newspapers discussed
      it for days, and turned over the scheme in every light, the most saying
      that it was a noble gift to the city that had been intended, while only
      one or two doubted if charity institutions of this sort really helped the
      poor. Regret, of course, was expressed that the second will had never been
      executed, but with this regret was the confidence that the widow would
      carry out, eventually, Henderson&rsquo;s plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      This revelation modified the opinion in regard to Henderson. He came to be
      regarded as a public benefactor, and his faithful wife shared the credit
      of his noble intention.

    <h2>
      XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Waiting for something to turn up, Jack found a weary business. He had
      written to Mavick after the newspaper report that that government officer
      had been in the city on Henderson&rsquo;s affairs, and had received a very civil
      and unsatisfactory reply. In the note Mavick had asked him to come to
      Washington and spend a little time, if he had nothing better on hand, as
      his guest. Perhaps no offense was intended, but the reply enraged Jack.
      There was in the tone of the letter and in the manner of the invitation a
      note of patronage that was unendurable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound the fellow&rsquo;s impudence!&rdquo; said Jack to himself; and he did not
      answer the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally his situation was desperate enough, but he was not inclined to
      face it. In a sort of stupor he let the law take its course. There was
      nothing left of his fortune, and his creditors were in possession of his
      house and all it contained. &ldquo;Do not try to keep anything back that legally
      belongs to them,&rdquo; Edith had written when he informed her of this last
      humiliation. Of course decency was observed. Jack&rsquo;s and Edith&rsquo;s wardrobes,
      and some pieces of ancestral furniture that he pointed out as belonging to
      his wife, were removed before the auction flag was hung out. When this was
      over he still temporized. Edith&rsquo;s affectionate entreaties to him to leave
      the dreadful city and come home were evaded on one plea or another. He had
      wild schemes of going off West or South&mdash;of disappearing. Perhaps he
      would have luck somewhere. He couldn&rsquo;t ask aid or seek occupation of his
      friends, but some place where he was not known he felt that he might do
      something to regain his position, get some situation, or make some money&mdash;lots
      of men had done it in a new country and reinstate himself in Edith&rsquo;s
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not go, and days and weeks went by in irresolution. No word
      came from Carmen, and this humiliated Jack more than anything else&mdash;not
      the loss of her friendship, but the remembrance that he had ever danced
      attendance on her and trusted her. He was getting a good many wholesome
      lessons in these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon he called upon Miss Tavish. There was no change in her. She
      received him with her usual gay cordiality, and with no affectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what had become of you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been busy,&rdquo; he replied, with a faint attempt at a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. It&rsquo;s been an awful time, what with Henderson&rsquo;s death and
      everything else. Almost everybody has been hit. But,&rdquo; and she looked at
      him cheerfully, &ldquo;they will come up again; up and down; it is always so.
      Why, even I got a little twist in that panic.&rdquo; The girl was doing what she
      could in her way to cheer him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of going off somewhere to seek my fortune,&rdquo; said Jack, with a
      rueful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not; your friends wouldn&rsquo;t like that. There is no place like
      New York, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; And there was a real note of friendliness and
      encouragement in her tone. &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; and she gave him another bright smile,
      &ldquo;I think of running away from it myself, for a time. It&rsquo;s a secret yet.
      Carmen wants me to go abroad with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen Mrs. Henderson since her husband&rsquo;s death. How is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she bears up wonderfully. But then she has so much to do, poor thing.
      And then the letters she gets, the begging letters. You&rsquo;ve no idea. I
      don&rsquo;t wonder she wants to go abroad. Don&rsquo;t stay away so long again,&rdquo; she
      said as Jack rose to go. &ldquo;And, oh, can&rsquo;t you come in to dinner tomorrow
      night&mdash;just Carmen&mdash;I think I can persuade her&mdash;and nobody
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I have an engagement,&rdquo; Jack answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some other time. Only soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This call did Jack temporarily a world of good. It helped his self-esteem.
      But it was only temporary. The black fact stared him in the face every
      morning that he was ruined. And it came over him gradually that he was a
      useless member of society. He never had done anything; he was not trained
      or fitted to do anything. And this was impressed upon him in the
      occasional attempts he made to get employment. He avoided as much as
      possible contact with those who knew him. Shame prevented him from
      applying to them for occupation, and besides he very well knew that to
      those who knew him his idle career was no recommendation. Yet he formed a
      habit of going down-town every day and looking for work. His appearance
      commanded civility, but everywhere he met with refusal, and he began to
      feel like a well-bred tramp. There had been in his mind before no excuse
      for tramps. He could see now how they were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that he lacked capacity. He knew a great deal, in an amateurish
      way, about pictures, books, bric-a-brac, and about society. Why shouldn&rsquo;t
      he write? He visited the Loan Exhibition, and wrote a careful criticism on
      the pictures and sent it to a well-known journal. It was returned with
      thanks: the journal had its own art critic. He prepared other articles
      about curious books, and one about porcelain and pottery. They were all
      returned, except one which gave the history of a rare bit of majolica,
      which had been picked up forty cents and then sold for five hundred
      dollars, and was now owned by a collector who had paid four thousand
      dollars for it. For that the newspaper sent him five dollars. That was not
      encouraging, and his next effort for the same journal was returned. Either
      he hadn&rsquo;t the newspaper knack, or the competition was too great.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ceased going to his club. It was too painful to meet his
      acquaintances in his altered circumstances, and it was too expensive. It
      even annoyed him to meet Major Fairfax. That philosopher had not changed
      towards him any more than Miss Tavish had, but it was a melancholy
      business to talk of his affairs, and to listen to the repeated advice to
      go down to the country to Edith, and wait for some good opening. That was
      just what he could not do. His whole frivolous life he began now to see as
      she must have seen it. And it seemed to him that he could only retain a
      remnant of his self-respect by doing something that would reinstate him in
      her opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the Major, at the close of the last of their talks at
      the club; &ldquo;what are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into some business,&rdquo; said Jack, stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you spoken to any of your friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said, bitterly; &ldquo;they are all like me, or they know
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hasn&rsquo;t your wife some relations who are in business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last people I should apply to. No. I&rsquo;m going to look around. Major,
      do you happen to know a cheap lodging-house that is respectable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any that is not respectable,&rdquo; the Major replied, in a huffy
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I want to reduce expenses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major did know of a place in the neighborhood where he lived. He gave
      Jack the address, and thereafter the club and his usual resorts knew him
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days went by and nothing happened to break the monotony of his
      waiting and his fruitless search, he became despondent. Day after day he
      tramped about the city, among the business portions, and often on the East
      Side, to see misery worse than his own. He had saved out of the wreck his
      ample wardrobe, his watch, and some jewelry, and upon these he raised
      money for his cheap lodgings and his cheap food. He grew careless of his
      personal appearance. Every morning he rose and went about the city, always
      with less hope, and every night he returned to his lodging, but not always
      sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he read the announcement that Mrs. Rodney Henderson and Miss
      Tavish had sailed for Europe. That ended that chapter. What exactly he had
      expected he could not say. Help from Carmen? Certainly not. But there had
      never been a sign from her, nor any word from Mavick lately. There
      evidently was nothing. He had been thrown over. Carmen evidently had no
      more use for him. She had other plans. The thought that he had been used
      and duped was almost more bitter than his loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      In after-days Jack looked back upon this time with a feeling akin to
      thankfulness for Carmen&rsquo;s utter heartlessness in regard to his affairs. He
      trembled to think what might have happened to him if she had sent for him
      and consulted him and drawn him again into the fatal embrace of her
      schemes and her fascinations. Now he was simply enraged when he thought of
      her, and irritated with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were dark days, days to which he looked back with a shudder. He
      wrote to Edith frequently&mdash;a brief note. He was straightening out his
      affairs; he was busy. But he did not give her his address, and he only got
      her letters when the Major forwarded them from the club, which was
      irregularly. A stranger, who met him at his lodgings or elsewhere, would
      have said that he was an idle and rather dissipated-looking man. He was
      idle, except in his feeble efforts to get work; he was worn and
      discouraged, but he was not doing anything very bad. In his way of looking
      at it, he was carrying out his notion of honor. He was only breaking a
      woman&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of little except his own misfortunes and misery. He did
      not yet apprehend his own selfishness nor her nobility. He did not yet
      comprehend the unselfishness of a good woman&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the East Side one day, as he was sauntering along Grand Street, he
      encountered Dr. Leigh, his wife&rsquo;s friend, whom he had seen once at his
      house. She did not at first recognize him until he stopped and spoke his
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with surprise at seeing him, and at his appearance, &ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t expect to see you here. I thought everybody had gone from the city.
      Perhaps you are going to the Neighborhood Guild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and Jack forced a little laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so good as that. I&rsquo;m kept
      in town on business. I strolled over here to see how the other side of
      life looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t improve. It is one of the worst summers I ever saw. Since Mr.
      Henderson&rsquo;s death&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference did Henderson&rsquo;s death make over here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he had deposited a little fund for Father Damon to draw on, and the
      day after his death the bank returned a small check with the notice that
      there was no deposit to draw on. It had been such a help in extraordinary
      cases. Perhaps you saw some allusion to it in the newspapers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it the Margaret Fund?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Father Damon dropped a note to Mrs. Henderson explaining about it.
      No reply came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he might have expected.&rdquo; Dr. Leigh looked up quickly as if for an
      explanation, but Jack ignored the query, and went on. &ldquo;And Father Damon,
      is he as active as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, left the city, quit his work? And the mission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he will ever quit his work while he lives, but he is much
      broken down. The mission chapel is not closed, but a poor woman told me
      that it seemed so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he will not return? Mrs. Delancy will be so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. He is in retreat now, and I heard that he might go to
      Baltimore. I thought of your wife. She was so interested in his work. Is
      she well this summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you,&rdquo; said Jack, and they parted. But as she went on her way
      his altered appearance struck her anew, and she wondered what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meeting with Mr. Delancy recalled most forcibly Edith, her interest
      in the East Side work, her sympathy with Father Damon and the mission, the
      first flush of those days of enthusiasm. When Father Damon began his work
      the ladies used to come in their carriages to the little chapel with
      flowers and money and hearts full of sympathy with the devoted priest.
      Alone of all these Edith had been faithful in her visits, always, when she
      was in town. And now the whole glittering show of charity had vanished for
      the time, and Father Damon&mdash;The little doctor stopped, consulted a
      memorandum in her hand-bag, looked up at the tenement-house she was
      passing, and then began to climb its rickety stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Father Damon had gone, and Ruth Leigh simply went on with her work as
      before. Perhaps in all the city that summer there was no other person
      whose daily life was so little changed as hers. Others were driven away by
      the heat, by temporary weariness, by the need of a vacation and change of
      scene. Some charities and some clubs and schools were temporarily
      suspended; other charities, befitting the name, were more active, the very
      young children were most looked after, and the Good Samaritans of the
      Fresh-Air Funds went about everywhere full of this new enthusiasm of
      humanity. But the occupation of Ruth Leigh remained always the same, in a
      faithful pertinacity that nothing could wholly discourage, in a routine
      that no projects could kindle into much enthusiasm. Day after day she went
      about among the sick and the poor, relieving and counseling individuals,
      and tiring herself out in that personal service, and more and more
      conscious, when she had time, at night, for instance, to think, of the
      monstrous injustice somewhere, and at times in a mood of fierce revolt
      against the social order that made all this misery possible and hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a great change had come into her life&mdash;the greatest that can come
      to any man or woman in the natural order. She loved and she was loved. An
      ideal light had been cast upon her commonplace existence, the depths of
      her own nature had been revealed to herself. In this illuminating light
      she walked about in the misery of this world. This love must be denied,
      this longing of the heart for companionship could never be gratified, yet
      after all it was a sweet self-sacrifice, and the love itself brought its
      own consolation. She had not to think of herself as weak, and neither was
      her lover&rsquo;s image dimmed to her by any surrender of his own principle or
      his own ideal. She saw him, as she had first seen him, a person
      consecrated and set apart, however much she might disagree with his
      supernatural vagaries&mdash;set apart to the service of humanity. She had
      bitter thoughts sometimes of the world, and bitter thoughts of the false
      system that controlled his conduct, but never of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unavoidable that she should recall her last interview with him, and
      that the image of his noble, spiritual face should be ever distinct in her
      mind. And there was even a certain comfort in this recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Damon had indeed striven, under the counsel of his own courage and
      of Brother Monies, to conquer himself on the field of his temptation. But
      with his frail physique it was asking too much. This at last was so
      evident that the good brother advised him, and the advice was in the
      nature of a command in his order, to retire for a while, and then take up
      his work in a fresh field.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was determined on, his desire was nearly irresistible to see
      Ruth Leigh; he thought it would be cowardly to disappear and not say
      good-by. Indeed, it was necessary to see her and explain the stoppage of
      help from the Margaret Fund. The check that he had drawn, which was
      returned, had been for one of Dr. Leigh&rsquo;s cases. With his failure to
      elicit any response from Mrs. Henderson, the hope, raised by the newspaper
      comments on the unexecuted will, that the fund would be renewed was
      dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the interview which Father Damon sought with Dr. Leigh at the Women&rsquo;s
      Hospital all this was explained, and ways and means were discussed for
      help elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to talk this over with you,&rdquo; said Father Damon, &ldquo;because I am
      going away to take a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need it, Father Damon,&rdquo; was Ruth&rsquo;s answer, in a professional manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and,&rdquo; he continued, with some hesitation, &ldquo;probably I shall not
      return to this mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that will be best,&rdquo; she said, simply, but looking up at him now,
      with a face full of tender sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it,&rdquo; he replied, turning away from her gaze. &ldquo;The fact is,
      doctor, I am a little hipped&mdash;overworked, and all that. I shall pull
      myself together with a little rest. But I wanted to tell you how much I
      appreciate your work, and&mdash;and what a comfort you have been to me in
      my poor labors. I used to hope that some time you would see this world in
      relation to the other, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she interrupted, hastily, &ldquo;I cannot think as you do, but&mdash;&rdquo;
       And she could not go on for a great lump in her throat. Involuntarily she
      rose from her seat. The interview was too trying. Father Damon rose also.
      There was a moment&rsquo;s painful silence as they looked in each other&rsquo;s faces.
      Neither could trust the voice for speech. He took her hand and pressed it,
      and said &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; and went out, closing the door softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment after he opened it again and stood on the threshold. She was in
      her chair, her head bowed upon her arms on the table. As he spoke she
      looked up, and she never forgot the expression of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say, Ruth&rdquo;&mdash;he had never before called her by her first
      name, and his accent thrilled her&mdash;&ldquo;that I shall pray for you as I
      pray for myself, and though I may never see you again in this world, the
      greatest happiness that can come to me in this life will be to hear that
      you have learned to say Our Father which art in heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she looked he was gone, and his last words remained a refrain in her
      mind that evening and afterwards&mdash;&ldquo;Our Father which art in heaven&rdquo;&mdash;a
      refrain recurring again and again in all her life, inseparable from the
      memory of the man she loved.

    <h2>
      XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Along the Long Island coast lay the haze of early autumn. It was the time
      of lassitude. In the season of ripening and decay Nature seemed to have
      lost her spring, and lay in a sort of delicious languor. Sea and shore
      were in a kind of truce, and the ocean south wind brought cool refreshment
      but no incentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the sea the old brown farmhouse seemed a snug haven of refuge; from
      the inland road it appeared, with its spreading, sloping roofs, like an
      ancient sea-craft come ashore, which had been covered in and then
      embowered by kindly Nature with foliage. In those days its golden-brown
      color was in harmony with the ripening orchards and gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely, if anywhere in the world, peace was here. But to its owner this
      very peace and quietness was becoming intolerable. The waiting days were
      so long, the sleepless nights of uncertainty were so weary. When her work
      was done, and Edith sat with a book or some sewing under the arbor where
      the grape clusters hung, growing dark and transparent, and the boy played
      about near her, she had a view of the blue sea, and about her were the
      twitter of birds and the hum of the cicada. The very beauty made her heart
      ache. Seaward there was nothing&mdash;nothing but the leaping little waves
      and the sky. From the land side help might come at any hour, and at every
      roll of wheels along the road her heart beat faster and hope sprang up
      anew. But day after day nothing came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there is no greater bravery than this sort of waiting, doing the
      daily duty and waiting. Endurance is woman&rsquo;s bravery, and Edith was
      enduring, with an almost broken but still with a courageous heart. It was
      all so strange. Was it simply shame that kept him away, or had he ceased
      to love her? If the latter, there was no help for her. She had begged him
      to come, she had offered to leave the boy with her cousin companion and go
      to him. Perhaps it was pride only. In one of his short letters he had
      said, &ldquo;Thank God, your little fortune is untouched.&rdquo; If it were pride
      only, how could she overcome it? Of this she thought night and day. She
      thought, and she was restless, feverish, and growing thin in her abiding
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true that her own fortune was safe and in her control. But with the
      usual instinct of women who know they have an income not likely to be ever
      increased, she began to be economical. She thought not of herself; but of
      the boy. It was the boy&rsquo;s fortune now. She began to look sharply after
      expenses; she reduced her household; she took upon herself the care of the
      boy, and other household duties. This was all well for her, for it
      occupied her time, and to some extent diverted her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the summer passed&mdash;a summer of anxiety, longing, and dull pain for
      Edith. The time came when the uncertainty of it could no longer be
      endured. If Jack had deserted her, even if he should die, she could order
      her life and try to adjust her heavy burden. But this uncertainty was
      quite beyond her power to sustain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made up her mind that she would go to the city and seek him. It was
      what he had written that she must not on any account do, but nothing that
      could happen to her there could be so bad as this suspense. Perhaps she
      could bring him back. If he refused, and was angry at her interference,
      that even would be something definite. And then she had carefully thought
      out another plan. It might fail, but some action had now become for her a
      necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early one morning&mdash;it was in September-she prepared for a journey to
      the city. This little trip, which thousands of people made daily, took on
      for her the air of an adventure. She had been immured so long that it
      seemed a great undertaking. And when she bade good-by to the boy for the
      day she hugged him and kissed him again and again, as if it were to be an
      eternal farewell. To her cousin were given the most explicit directions
      for his care, and after she had started for the train she returned to give
      further injunctions. So she told herself, but it was really for one more
      look at the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the whole there was a certain exhilaration in the preparation and
      the going, and her spirits rose as they had not done in months before.
      Arrived in the city, she drove at once to the club Jack most frequented.
      &ldquo;He is not in,&rdquo; the porter said; &ldquo;indeed, Mr. Delancy has not been here
      lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Major Fairfax in?&rdquo; Edith asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Fairfax was in, and he came out immediately to her carriage. From
      him she learned Jack&rsquo;s address, and drove to his lodging-house. The Major
      was more than civil; he was disposed to be sympathetic, but he had the
      tact to see that Mrs. Delancy did not wish to be questioned, nor to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Delancy at home?&rdquo; she asked the small boy who ran the elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo;me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he did not say where he was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo;me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he not sometimes at home in the daytime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rsquo;me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what time does he usually come home in the evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. After I&rsquo;ve gone, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edith hesitated whether she should leave a card or a note, but she decided
      not to do either, and ordered the cabman to take her to Pearl Street, to
      the house of Fletcher &amp; Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher, the senior partner, was her cousin, the son of her father&rsquo;s
      elder brother, and a man now past sixty years. Circumstances had carried
      the families apart socially since the death of her father and his brother,
      but they were on the most friendly terms, and the ties of blood were not
      in any way weakened. Indeed, although Edith had seen Gilbert Fletcher only
      a few times since her marriage, she felt that she could go to him any time
      if she were in trouble, with the certainty of sympathy and help. He had
      the reputation of the old-fashioned New York merchants, to whom her father
      belonged, for integrity and conservatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to him that she went now. The great shop, or wholesale warehouse
      rather, into which she entered from the narrow and cart-encumbered street,
      showed her at once the nature of the business of Fletcher &amp; Co. It was
      something in the twine and cordage way. There were everywhere great coils
      of ropes and bales of twine, and the dark rooms had a tarry smell. Mr.
      Fletcher was in his office, a little space partitioned off in the rear,
      with half a dozen clerks working by gaslight, and a little sanctum where
      the senior partner was commonly found at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher was a little, round-headed man, with a shrewd face, vigorous
      and cheerful, thoroughly a man of business, never speculating, and who had
      been slowly gaining wealth by careful industry and cautious extension of
      his trade. Certain hours of the day&mdash;from ten to three&mdash;he gave
      to his business. It was a habit, and it was a habit that he enjoyed. He
      had now come back, as he told Edith, from a little holiday at the sea,
      where his family were, to get into shape for the fall trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith was closeted with him for a full hour. When she came out her eyes
      were brighter and her step more elastic. At sundown she reached home,
      almost in high spirits. And when she snatched up the boy and hugged him,
      she whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Baby, we have done it, and we shall see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One night when Jack returned from his now almost aimless tramping about
      the city he found a letter on his table. It seemed from the printing on
      the envelope to be a business letter; and business, in the condition he
      was in&mdash;and it was the condition in which he usually came home&mdash;did
      not interest him. He was about to toss the letter aside, when the name of
      Fletcher caught his eye, and he opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a brief note, written on an office memorandum, which simply asked
      Mr. Delancy to call at the office as soon as it was convenient, as the
      writer wished to talk with him on a matter of business, and it was signed
      &ldquo;Gilbert Fletcher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he say what his business is?&rdquo; said Jack, throwing the letter
      down impatiently. &ldquo;I am not going to be hauled over the coals by any of
      the Fletchers.&rdquo; And he tumbled into bed in an injured and yet independent
      frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next morning he reread the formal little letter in a new light. To
      be sure, it was from Edith&rsquo;s cousin. He knew him very well; he was not a
      person to go out of his way to interfere with anybody, and more than
      likely it was in relation to Edith&rsquo;s affairs that he was asked to call.
      That thought put a new aspect on the matter. Of course if it concerned her
      interests he ought to go. He dressed with unusual care for him in these
      days, breakfasted at the cheap restaurant which he frequented, and before
      noon was in the Fletcher warehouse in Pearl Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never been there before, and he was somewhat curious to see what
      sort of a place it was where Gilbert carried on the string business, as he
      used to call it when speaking to Edith of her cousin&rsquo;s occupation. It was
      a much more dingy and smelly place than he expected, but the carts about
      the doors, and the bustle of loading and unloading, of workmen hauling and
      pulling, and of clerks calling out names and numbers to be registered and
      checked, gave him the impression that it was not a dull place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher received him in the little dim back office with a cordial
      shake of the hand, gave him a chair, and reseated himself, pushing back
      the papers in front of him with the air of a very busy man who was
      dropping for a moment one thing in order to give his mind promptly to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our fall trade is just starting up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it keeps us all pretty
      busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I could drop in any other time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Fletcher; &ldquo;it is just because I am busy that I
      wanted to see you. Are you engaged in anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in particular,&rdquo; replied Jack, hesitating. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d thought of going
      into some business.&rdquo; And then, after a pause: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use to mince
      matters. You know&mdash;everybody knows, I suppose&mdash;that I got hit in
      that Henderson panic.&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0383}.jpg" alt="{0383}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0383}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;So did lots of others,&rdquo; replied Mr. Fletcher, cheerfully. &ldquo;Yes, I know
      about it. And I&rsquo;m not sure but it was a lucky thing for me.&rdquo; He spoke
      still more cheerfully, and Jack looked at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you open to an offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m open to almost anything,&rdquo; Jack answered, with a puzzled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; and Mr. Fletcher settled back in his chair, &ldquo;I can give you the
      situation in five minutes. I&rsquo;ve been in this business over thirty years&mdash;yes;
      over thirty-five years. It has grown, little by little, until it&rsquo;s a
      pretty big business. I&rsquo;ve a partner, a first-rate man&mdash;he is in
      Europe now&mdash;who attends to most of the buying. And the business keeps
      spreading out, and needs more care. I&rsquo;m not as young as I was I shall be
      sixty-four in October&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t work right along as I used to. I
      find that I come later and go away earlier. It isn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;work exactly,
      but the oversight, the details; and the fact is that I want somebody near
      me whom I can trust, whether I&rsquo;m here or whether I&rsquo;m away. I&rsquo;ve got good,
      honest, faithful clerks&mdash;if there was one I did not trust, I wouldn&rsquo;t
      have him about. But do you know, Jack,&rdquo; it was the first time in the
      interview that he had used this name&mdash;&ldquo;there is something in blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Jack assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want a confidential clerk. That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; he asked. He was thinking rapidly while Mr. Fletcher had been
      speaking; something like a revolution was taking place in his mind, and
      when he asked this, the suggestion took on a humorous aspect&mdash;a
      humorous view of anything had not occurred to him in months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be confidential,&rdquo; Jack rejoined, with the old smile on his face
      that had been long a stranger to it, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know that I can be a
      clerk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher was good enough to laugh at this pleasantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. It isn&rsquo;t much of a position. We can make the salary
      twenty-five hundred dollars for a starter. Will you try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack got up and went to the area window, and looked out a moment upon the
      boxes in the dim court. Then he came back and stood by Mr. Fletcher, and
      put his hand on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. When will you begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. No time like now. Wait a bit, and I&rsquo;ll show you about the
      place before we go to lunch. You&rsquo;ll get hold of the ropes directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was Mr. Fletcher&rsquo;s veteran joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock Mr. Fletcher closed his desk. It was time to take his
      train. &ldquo;Tomorrow, then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will begin in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the business hours here?&rdquo; asked Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am usually here from ten to three, but the business hours are from
      nine till the business is done. By-the-way, why not run out with me and
      spend the night, and we can talk the thing over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason why he should not go, and he went. And that was the
      way John Corlear Delancy was initiated in the string business in the old
      house of Fletcher &amp; Co.

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Few battles are decisive, and perhaps least of all those that are won by a
      sudden charge or an accident, and not as the result of long-maturing
      causes. Doubtless the direction of a character or a career is often turned
      by a sudden act of the will or a momentary impotence of the will. But the
      battle is not over then, nor without long and arduous fighting, often a
      dreary, dragging struggle without the excitement of novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was comparatively easy for Jack Delancy in Mr. Fletcher&rsquo;s office to
      face about suddenly and say yes to the proposal made him. There was on him
      the pressure of necessity, of his own better nature acting under a sense
      of his wife&rsquo;s approval; and besides, there was a novelty that attracted
      him in trying something absolutely new to his habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was one thing to begin, and another, with a man of his temperament,
      to continue. To have regular hours, to attend to the details of a traffic
      that was to the last degree prosaic, in short, to settle down to hard
      work, was a very different thing from the &ldquo;business&rdquo; about which Jack and
      his fellows at the club used to talk so much, and to fancy they were
      engaged in. When the news came to the Union that Delancy had gone into the
      house of Fletcher &amp; Co. as a clerk, there was a general smile, and a
      languid curiosity expressed as to how long he would stick to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first day or two Jack was sustained not only by the original
      impulse, but by a real instinct in learning about business ways and
      details that were new to him. To talk about the business and about the
      markets, to hear plans unfolded for extension and for taking advantage of
      fluctuations in prices, was all very well; but the drudgery of details&mdash;copying,
      comparing invoices, and settling into the routine of a clerk&rsquo;s life, even
      the life of a confidential clerk&mdash;was contrary to the habits of his
      whole life. It was not to be expected that these habits would be overcome
      without a long struggle and many back-slidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little matter of being at his office desk at nine o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning began to seem a hardship after the first three or four days. For
      Mr. Fletcher not to walk into his shop on the stroke of ten would have
      been such a reversal of his habits as to cause him as much annoyance as it
      caused Jack to be bound to a fixed hour. It was only the difference in
      training. But that is saying everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, while the details of his work, the more he got settled in them,
      were not to his taste, he was daily mortified to find himself ignorant of
      matters which the stupidest clerk in the office seemed to know by
      instinct. This acted, however, as a sort of stimulus, and touched his
      pride. He determined that he would not be humiliated in this way, and
      during office hours he worked as diligently as Mr. Fletcher could have
      desired. He had pledged himself to the trial, and he summoned all his
      intelligence to back his effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is true that the satisfaction of having a situation, of doing
      something, the relief to the previous daily anxiety and almost despair,
      raised his spirits. It was only when he thought of the public opinion of
      his little world, of some other occupation more befitting his education,
      of the vast change from his late life of ease and luxury to this of daily
      labor with a clerk&rsquo;s pay, that he had hours of revolt and cursed his luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Jack&rsquo;s battle was not won in a day, or a week, or a year. And before
      it was won he needed more help than his own somewhat irresolute will could
      give. It is the impression of his biographer that he would have failed in
      the end if he had been married to a frivolous and selfish woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fletcher was known as a very strict man of business, and as little
      else. But he was a good judge of character, and under his notions of
      discipline and of industry he was a kindly man, as his clerks, who feared
      his sharp oversight, knew. And besides, he had made a compact with Edith,
      for whom he had something more than family affection, and he watched
      Jack&rsquo;s efforts to adjust himself to the new life with sympathy. If it was
      an experiment for Jack, it was also an experiment for him, the result of
      which gave him some anxiety. The situation was not a very heroic one, but
      a life is often decided for good or ill by as insignificant a matter as
      Jack&rsquo;s ability to persevere in learning about the twine and cordage trade.
      This was a day of trial, and the element of uncertainty in it kept both
      Mr. Fletcher and Jack from writing of the new arrangement to Edith, for
      fear that only disappointment to her would be the ultimate result. Jack&rsquo;s
      brief notes to her were therefore, as usual, indefinite, but with the hint
      that he was beginning to see a way out of his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the passage of a couple of weeks, during which Mr. Fletcher had been
      quietly studying his new clerk, he suddenly said to him, one Saturday
      morning, after they had looked over and estimated the orders by the day&rsquo;s
      mail, &ldquo;Jack, I think you&rsquo;d better let up a little, and run down and see
      Edith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Jack, a little startled by the proposal, but recovering
      himself; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose the business could spare me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean a vacation, but run down for over Sunday. It must be lovely
      there, and the change will make you as keen as a brier for business. It
      always does me. Stay over Monday if the weather is good. I have to be away
      myself the week after.&rdquo; As Jack hesitated and did not reply, Mr. Fletcher
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think you&rsquo;d better go, Jack. You have hardly had a breath of
      fresh air this summer. There&rsquo;s plenty of time to go up-town and get your
      grip and catch the afternoon train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack was still silent. The thought of seeing Edith created a tumult in his
      mind. It seemed as if he were not quite ready, not exactly settled. He had
      been procrastinating so long, putting off going, on one pretext or
      another, that he had fallen into a sort of fear of going. At first,
      absorbed in his speculations, enthralled by the company of Carmen and the
      luxurious, easy-going view of life that her society created for him; he
      had felt Edith and his house as an irritating restraint. Later, when the
      smash came, he had been still more relieved that she was out of town. And
      finally he had fallen into a reckless apathy, and had made himself believe
      that he never would see her again until some stroke of fortune should set
      him on his feet and restore his self-respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since he had been with Fletcher &amp; Co. his feelings had gradually
      undergone a change. With a regular occupation and regular hours, and in
      contact with the sensible mind and business routine of Mr. Fletcher, he
      began to have saner views of life, and to realize that Edith would approve
      what he was now attempting to do much more than any effort to relieve
      himself by speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he felt himself a little more firmly established, a little more
      sure of himself, he would go to Edith, and confess everything, and begin
      life anew. This had been his mood, but he was still irresolute, and it
      needed some outside suggestion to push him forward to overcome his
      lingering reluctance to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this had come suddenly. It seemed to him at first thought that he
      needed time to prepare for it. Mr. Fletcher pulled out his watch. &ldquo;There
      is a later train at four. Take that, and we will get some lunch first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour of postponement was such a relief! Why, of course he could go at
      four. And instantly his heart leaped up with desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, as he rose and closed his desk. &ldquo;But I think I&rsquo;d
      better not stay for lunch. I want to get something for the boy on my way
      uptown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Tuesday, then. My best regards to Edith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Jack came down the stairway from the elevated road at Twenty-third
      Street he ran against a man who was hurrying up&mdash;a man in a
      pronounced traveling-suit, grip-sack and umbrella in hand, and in haste.
      It was Mavick. Recognition was instantaneous, and it was impossible for
      either to avoid the meeting if he had desired to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You in town!&rdquo; said Mavick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you!&rdquo; Jack retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not really. I&rsquo;m just going to catch the steamer. Short leave. We have
      all been kept by that confounded Chile business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going for the government?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not publicly. Of course shall confer with our minister in London. Any
      news here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Henderson&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; And Jack looked Mavick squarely in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; And Mavick smiled faintly, and then said, gravely: &ldquo;It was an awful
      business. So sudden, you know, that I couldn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo; He made a
      movement to pass on. &ldquo;I suppose there has been no&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;except that Mrs. Henderson has gone to
      Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; And Mr. Mavick didn&rsquo;t wait for further news, but hurried up, with a
      &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Mavick was following Carmen to Europe. Well, why not? What an unreal
      world it all was, that of a few months ago! The gigantic Henderson; Jack&rsquo;s
      own vision of a great fortune; Carmen and her house of Nero; the astute
      and diplomatic Mavick, with his patronizing airs! It was like a scene in a
      play.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into a shop and selected a toy for the boy. It was a real toy,
      and it was for a real boy. Jack experienced a genuine pleasure at the
      thought of pleasing him. Perhaps the little fellow would not know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he thought of Edith&mdash;not of Edith the mother, but of Edith
      the girl in the days of his wooing. And he went into Maillard&rsquo;s. The
      pretty girl at the counter knew him. He was an old customer, and she had
      often filled orders for him. She had despatched many a costly box to
      addresses he had given her. It was in the recollection of those
      transactions that he said: &ldquo;A box of marrons glaces, please. My wife
      prefers that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I send it?&rdquo; asked the girl, when she had done it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks; we are not in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, beaming upon him; &ldquo;nobody is yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this girl also seemed a part of the old life, with her little
      affectation of familiarity with its ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to his room&mdash;it seemed a very mean little room now&mdash;packed
      his bag, told the janitor he should be absent a few days, and hurried to
      the ferry and the train as if he feared that some accident would delay
      him. When he was seated and the train moved off, his thoughts took another
      turn. He was in for it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to regret that he had not delayed, to think it all out more
      thoroughly; perhaps it would have been better to have written.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought an evening journal, but he could not read it. What he read
      between the lines was his own life. What a miserable failure! What a mess
      he had made of his own affairs, and how unworthy of such a woman as Edith
      he had been! How indifferent he had been to her happiness in the pursuit
      of his own pleasure! How would she receive him? He could hardly doubt
      that; but she must know, she must have felt cruelly his estrangement. What
      if she met him with a royal forgiveness, as if he were a returned
      prodigal? He couldn&rsquo;t stand that. If now he were only going back with his
      fortune recovered, with brilliant prospects to spread before her, and
      could come into the house in his old playful manner, with the assumed
      deference of the master, and say: &ldquo;Well, Edith dear, the storm is over.
      It&rsquo;s all right now. I am awfully glad to get home. Where&rsquo;s the rascal of
      an heir?&rdquo;
     </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:50%;"> <img src="images/{0397}.jpg" alt="{0397}" width="100%" /><br /> </div> <h5> <a href="images/{0397}.jpg"> <img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a> </h5>

    <p>
      Instead of that, he was going with nothing, humiliated, a clerk in a
      twine-store. And not much of a clerk at that, he reflected, with his ready
      humorous recognition of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he was for the first time in his life earning his living. Edith
      would like that. He had known all along that his idle life had been a
      constant grief to her. No, she would not reproach him; she never did
      reproach him. No doubt she would be glad that he was at work. But, oh, the
      humiliation of the whole thing! At one moment he was eager to see her, and
      the next the rattling train seemed to move too fast, and he welcomed every
      wayside stop that delayed his arrival. But even the Long Island trains
      arrive some time, and all too soon the cars slowed up at the familiar
      little station, and Jack got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a stranger in these parts, Mr. Delancy,&rdquo; was the easy salutation of
      the station-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve been away. All right down here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right as a trivet. Hot summer, though. Calculate it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be a warm
      fall&mdash;generally is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was near sunset. When the train had moved on, and its pounding on the
      rails became a distant roar and then was lost altogether, the country
      silence so impressed Jack, as he walked along the road towards the sea,
      that he became distinctly conscious of the sound of his own footsteps. He
      stopped and listened. Yes, there were other sounds&mdash;the twitter of
      birds in the bushes by the roadside, the hum of insects, and the faint
      rhythmical murmur of lapsing waves on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the house came in view&mdash;first the big roof, and then the
      latticed windows, the balconies, where there were pots of flowers, and
      then the long veranda with its hammocks and climbing vines. There was a
      pink tone in the distant water answering to the flush in the sky, and away
      to the west the sand-dune that made out into the Sound was a point of
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the house! Jack&rsquo;s steps were again arrested. The level last rays of
      the disappearing sun flashed upon the window-panes so that they glowed
      like painted windows illuminated from within, with a reddish lustre, and
      the roofs and the brown sides of the building, painted by those great
      masters in color, the sun and the sea-wind, in that moment were like
      burnished gold. Involuntarily Jack exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Golden House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made his way through the little fore yard. No one was about. The
      veranda was deserted. There was Edith&rsquo;s work-basket; there were the baby&rsquo;s
      playthings. The door stood open, and as he approached it he heard singing&mdash;not
      singing, either, but a fitful sort of recitation, with the occasional
      notes of an accompaniment struck as if in absence of mind. The tune he
      knew, and as he passed through the first room towards the sitting-room
      that looked on the sea he caught a line:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wely, wely, but love is bonny, for a little while&mdash;when it is new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an old English ballad, the ballad of the &ldquo;Cockle-shells,&rdquo; that
      Edith used to sing often in the old days, when its note of melancholy
      seemed best to express her happiness. It was only that line, and the voice
      seemed to break, and there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole along and looked in. There was Edith, seated, her head bowed on
      her hands, at the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant, before she could turn to the sound of his quick footsteps,
      he was at her side, kneeling, his head bowed in the folds of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edith! I&rsquo;ve been such a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned, slid from her seat, and was kneeling also, with her arms
      thrown about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jack! You&rsquo;ve come. Thank God! Thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And presently they stood, and his arms were still around her, and she was
      looking up into his face, with her hands on his shoulders, and saying
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, forever.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The whole landscape was golden, the sea was silver, on that October
      morning. It was the brilliant decline of the year. Edith stood with Jack
      on the veranda. He had his grip-sack in hand and was equipped for town.
      Both were silent in the entrancing scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds, twittering in the fruit-trees and over the vines, had the air
      of an orchestra, the concerts of the season over, gathering their
      instruments and about to depart. One could detect in the lapse of the
      waves along the shore the note of weariness preceding the change into the
      fretfulness and the tumult of tempests. In the soft ripening of the season
      there was peace and hope, but it was the hope of another day. The curtain
      was falling on this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was life beginning, then, or ending? If life only could change and renew
      itself like the seasons, with the perpetually recurring springs! But youth
      comes only once, and thereafter the man gathers the fruit of it, sweet or
      bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack was not given to moralizing, but perhaps a subtle suggestion of this
      came to him in the thought that an enterprise, a new enterprise, might
      have seemed easier in May, when the forces of nature were with him, than
      in October. There was something, at least, that fell in with his mood, a
      mood of acquiescence in failure, in this closing season of the year, when
      he stood empty-handed in the harvest-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edith,&rdquo; he said, as they paced down the walk which was flaming with
      scarlet and crimson borders, and turned to look at the peaceful brown
      house, &ldquo;I hate to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not going,&rdquo; said Edith, brightly. &ldquo;I feel all the time as if
      you were just coming back. Jack, do you know,&rdquo; and she put her hand on his
      shoulder, &ldquo;this is the sweetest home in the world now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the only one, dear;&rdquo; and Jack made the statement with a humorous
      sense of its truth. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s the train, and I&rsquo;m off with the other
      clerks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clerk, indeed!&rdquo; cried Edith, putting up her face to his; &ldquo;you are going
      to be a Merchant Prince, Jack, that is what you are going to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the train there was an atmosphere of business. Jack felt that he was
      not going to the New York that he knew&mdash;not to his New York, but to a
      city of traffic; down into the streets of commercial enterprise, not at
      all to the metropolis of leisure, of pleasure, to the world of clubs and
      drawing-rooms and elegant loiterings and the rivalries of society life.
      That was all ended. Jack was hurrying to catch the down-town car for the
      dingy office of Fletcher &amp; Co. at an hour fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ended, to be sure, but the struggle with Jack in his new life was
      not ended, his biographer knows, for months and years.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before he could pass his club windows without a pang of
      humiliation, or lift his hat to a lady of his acquaintance in her passing
      carriage without a vivid feeling of separateness from his old life. For
      the old life&mdash;he could see that any day in the Avenue, any evening by
      the flaming lights&mdash;went by in its gilded chariots and entrancing
      toilets, the fascinating whirl of Vanity Fair crowned with roses and with
      ennui. Did he regret it? No doubt. Not to regret would have been to change
      his nature, and that were a feat impossible for his biographer to
      accomplish. In a way his life was gone, and to build up a new life, serene
      and enduring, was not the work of a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing he did not regret in the shock he had received, and that was the
      absence of Carmen and her world. When he thought of her he had a sense of
      escape. She was still abroad, and he heard from time to time that Mavick
      was philandering about from capital to capital in her train. Certainly he
      would have envied neither of them if he had been aware, as the reader is
      aware, of the guilty secret that drew them together and must be forever
      their torment. They knew each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this glittering world, to attain a place in which is the object of
      most of the struggles and hungry competition of modern life, seemed not so
      real nor so desirable when he was at home with Edith, and in his gradually
      growing interest in nobler pursuits. They had decided to take a modest
      apartment in town for the winter, and almost before the lease was signed,
      Edith, in her mind, had transformed it into a charming home. Jack used to
      rally her on her enthusiasm in its simple furnishing; it reminded him, he
      said, of Carmen&rsquo;s interest in her projected house of Nero. It was a great
      contrast, to be sure, to their stately house by the Park, but it was to
      them both what that had never been. To one who knows how life goes astray
      in the solicitations of the great world, there was something pathetic in
      Edith&rsquo;s pleasure. Even to Jack it might some day come with the force of
      keen regret for years wasted, that it is enough to break a body&rsquo;s heart to
      see how little a thing can make a woman happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was another summer. Major Fairfax had come down with Jack to spend
      Sunday at the Golden House. Edith was showing the Major the view from the
      end of the veranda. Jack was running through the evening paper. &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; he
      cried; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s news. Mavick is to have the mission to Rome, and it is
      rumored that the rich and accomplished Mrs. Henderson, as the wife of the
      minister, will make the Roman season very gay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said Edith. &ldquo;Nothing is said about the training-school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Poor Henderson!&rdquo; was the Major&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;It was for this
      that he drudged and schemed and heaped up his colossal fortune! His life
      must look to him like a burlesque.&rdquo;
     </p>

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
