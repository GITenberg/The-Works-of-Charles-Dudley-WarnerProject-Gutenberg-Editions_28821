    <h2>
      INTRODUCTORY SKETCH
    </h2>
    <p>
      The title naturally suggested for this story was &ldquo;A Dead Soul,&rdquo; but it was
      discarded because of the similarity to that of the famous novel by Nikolai
      Gogol&mdash;&ldquo;Dead Souls&rdquo;&mdash;though the motive has nothing in common
      with that used by the Russian novelist. Gogol exposed an extensive fraud
      practiced by the sale, in connection with lands, of the names of &ldquo;serfs&rdquo;
       (called souls) not living, or &ldquo;dead souls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This story is an attempt to trace the demoralization in a woman&rsquo;s soul of
      certain well-known influences in our existing social life. In no other way
      could certain phases of our society be made to appear so distinctly as
      when reflected in the once pure mirror of a woman&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The character of Margaret is the portrait of no one woman. But it was
      suggested by the career of two women (among others less marked) who had
      begun life with the highest ideals, which had been gradually eaten away
      and destroyed by &ldquo;prosperous&rdquo; marriages and association with unscrupulous
      methods of acquiring money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deterioration was gradual. The women were in all outward conduct
      unchanged, the conventionalities of life were maintained, the graces were
      not lost, the observances of the duties of charities and of religion were
      even emphasized, but worldliness had eaten the heart out of them, and they
      were &ldquo;dead souls.&rdquo; The tragedy of the withered life was a thousand-fold
      enhanced by the external show of prosperous respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story was first published (in 1888) in Harper&rsquo;s Monthly. During its
      progress&mdash;and it was printed as soon as each installment was ready (a
      very poor plan)&mdash;I was in receipt of the usual letters of sympathy,
      or protest, and advice. One sympathetic missive urged the removal of
      Margaret to a neighboring city, where she could be saved by being brought
      under special Christian influences. The transfer, even in a serial, was
      impossible, and she by her own choice lived the life she had entered upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, if the reader will pardon the confidence, pity intervened to
      shorten it. I do not know how it is with other writers, but the persons
      that come about me in a little drama are as real as those I meet in
      every-day life, and in this case I found it utterly impossible to go on to
      what might have been the bitter, logical development of Margaret&rsquo;s career.
      Perhaps it was as well. Perhaps the writer should have no despotic power
      over his creations, however slight they are. He may profitably recall the
      dictum of a recent essayist that &ldquo;there is no limit to the mercy of God.&rdquo;

    <p>
      We were talking about the want of diversity in American life, the lack of
      salient characters. It was not at a club. It was a spontaneous talk of
      people who happened to be together, and who had fallen into an uncompelled
      habit of happening to be together. There might have been a club for the
      study of the Want of Diversity in American Life. The members would have
      been obliged to set apart a stated time for it, to attend as a duty, and
      to be in a mood to discuss this topic at a set hour in the future. They
      would have mortgaged another precious portion of the little time left us
      for individual life. It is a suggestive thought that at a given hour all
      over the United States innumerable clubs might be considering the Want of
      Diversity in American Life. Only in this way, according to our present
      methods, could one expect to accomplish anything in regard to this
      foreign-felt want. It seems illogical that we could produce diversity by
      all doing the same thing at the same time, but we know the value of
      congregate effort. It seems to superficial observers that all Americans
      are born busy. It is not so. They are born with a fear of not being busy;
      and if they are intelligent and in circumstances of leisure, they have
      such a sense of their responsibility that they hasten to allot all their
      time into portions, and leave no hour unprovided for. This is
      conscientiousness in women, and not restlessness. There is a day for
      music, a day for painting, a day for the display of tea-gowns, a day for
      Dante, a day for the Greek drama, a day for the Dumb Animals&rsquo; Aid Society,
      a day for the Society for the Propagation of Indians, and so on. When the
      year is over, the amount that has been accomplished by this incessant
      activity can hardly be estimated. Individually it may not be much. But
      consider where Chaucer would be but for the work of the Chaucer clubs, and
      what an effect upon the universal progress of things is produced by the
      associate concentration upon the poet of so many minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cynic says that clubs and circles are for the accumulation of
      superficial information and unloading it on others, without much
      individual absorption in anybody. This, like all cynicism, contains only a
      half-truth, and simply means that the general diffusion of half-digested
      information does not raise the general level of intelligence, which can
      only be raised to any purpose by thorough self-culture, by assimilation,
      digestion, meditation. The busy bee is a favorite simile with us, and we
      are apt to overlook the fact that the least important part of his example
      is buzzing around. If the hive simply got together and buzzed, or even
      brought unrefined treacle from some cyclopaedia, let us say, of treacle,
      there would be no honey added to the general store.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to some one in this talk at last to deny that there was this
      tiresome monotony in American life. And this put a new face on the
      discussion. Why should there be, with every race under the heavens
      represented here, and each one struggling to assert itself, and no
      homogeneity as yet established even between the people of the oldest
      States? The theory is that democracy levels, and that the anxious pursuit
      of a common object, money, tends to uniformity, and that facility of
      communication spreads all over the land the same fashion in dress; and
      repeats everywhere the same style of house, and that the public schools
      give all the children in the United States the same superficial smartness.
      And there is a more serious notion, that in a society without classes
      there is a sort of tyranny of public opinion which crushes out the play of
      individual peculiarities, without which human intercourse is
      uninteresting. It is true that a democracy is intolerant of variations
      from the general level, and that a new society allows less latitude in
      eccentricities to its members than an old society.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with all these allowances, it is also admitted that the difficulty the
      American novelist has is in hitting upon what is universally accepted as
      characteristic of American life, so various are the types in regions
      widely separated from each other, such different points of view are had
      even in conventionalities, and conscience operates so variously on moral
      problems in one community and another. It is as impossible for one section
      to impose upon another its rules of taste and propriety in conduct&mdash;and
      taste is often as strong to determine conduct as principle&mdash;as it is
      to make its literature acceptable to the other. If in the land of the sun
      and the jasmine and the alligator and the fig, the literature of New
      England seems passionless and timid in face of the ruling emotions of
      life, ought we not to thank Heaven for the diversity of temperament as
      well as of climate which will in the long-run save us from that sameness
      into which we are supposed to be drifting?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think of this vast country with any attention to local developments
      I am more impressed with the unlikenesses than with the resemblances. And
      besides this, if one had the ability to draw to the life a single
      individual in the most homogeneous community, the product would be
      sufficiently startling. We cannot flatter ourselves, therefore, that under
      equal laws and opportunities we have rubbed out the saliencies of human
      nature. At a distance the mass of the Russian people seem as monotonous as
      their steppes and their commune villages, but the Russian novelists find
      characters in this mass perfectly individualized, and, indeed, give us the
      impression that all Russians are irregular polygons. Perhaps if our
      novelists looked at individuals as intently, they might give the world the
      impression that social life here is as unpleasant as it appears in the
      novels to be in Russia.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is partly the substance of what was said one winter evening before
      the wood fire in the library of a house in Brandon, one of the lesser New
      England cities. Like hundreds of residences of its kind, it stood in the
      suburbs, amid forest-trees, commanding a view of city spires and towers on
      the one hand, and on the other of a broken country of clustering trees and
      cottages, rising towards a range of hills which showed purple and warm
      against the pale straw-color of the winter sunsets. The charm of the
      situation was that the house was one of many comfortable dwellings, each
      isolated, and yet near enough together to form a neighborhood; that is to
      say, a body of neighbors who respected each other&rsquo;s privacy, and yet
      flowed together, on occasion, without the least conventionality. And a
      real neighborhood, as our modern life is arranged, is becoming more and
      more rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not sure that the talkers in this conversation expressed their real,
      final sentiments, or that they should be held accountable for what they
      said. Nothing so surely kills the freedom of talk as to have some
      matter-of-fact person instantly bring you to book for some impulsive
      remark flashed out on the instant, instead of playing with it and tossing
      it about in a way that shall expose its absurdity or show its value.
      Freedom is lost with too much responsibility and seriousness, and the
      truth is more likely to be struck out in a lively play of assertion and
      retort than when all the words and sentiments are weighed. A person very
      likely cannot tell what he does think till his thoughts are exposed to the
      air, and it is the bright fallacies and impulsive, rash ventures in
      conversation that are often most fruitful to talker and listeners. The
      talk is always tame if no one dares anything. I have seen the most
      promising paradox come to grief by a simple &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Nobody, I
      sometimes think, should be held accountable for anything said in private
      conversation, the vivacity of which is in a tentative play about the
      subject. And this is a sufficient reason why one should repudiate any
      private conversation reported in the newspapers. It is bad enough to be
      held fast forever to what one writes and prints, but to shackle a man with
      all his flashing utterances, which may be put into his mouth by some imp
      in the air, is intolerable slavery. A man had better be silent if he can
      only say today what he will stand by tomorrow, or if he may not launch
      into the general talk the whim and fancy of the moment. Racy, entertaining
      talk is only exposed thought, and no one would hold a man responsible for
      the thronging thoughts that contradict and displace each other in his
      mind. Probably no one ever actually makes up his mind until he either acts
      or puts out his conclusion beyond his recall. Why should one be debarred
      the privilege of pitching his crude ideas into a conversation where they
      may have a chance of being precipitated?
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that Morgan said in this talk that there was too much
      diversity. &ldquo;Almost every church has trouble with it&mdash;the different
      social conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An Englishman who was present pricked-up his ears at this, as if he
      expected to obtain a note on the character of Dissenters. &ldquo;I thought all
      the churches here were organized on social affinities?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; it is a good deal a matter of vicinage. When there is a
      real-estate extension, a necessary part of the plan is to build a church
      in the centre of it, in order to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Page,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morgan, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll give Mr. Lyon a totally
      erroneous notion. Of course there must be a church convenient to the
      worshipers in every district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I was saying, my dear: As the settlement is not drawn
      together on religious grounds, but perhaps by purely worldly motives, the
      elements that meet in the church are apt to be socially incongruous, such
      as cannot always be fused even by a church-kitchen and a church-parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn&rsquo;t the peculiarity of the church that has attracted to it
      worshipers who would naturally come together, but the church is a
      neighborhood necessity?&rdquo; still further inquired Mr. Lyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is,&rdquo; I ventured to put in, &ldquo;that churches grow up like schoolhouses,
      where they are wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Morgan; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking about the kind of want
      that creates them. If it&rsquo;s the same that builds a music hall, or a
      gymnasium, or a railway waiting-room, I&rsquo;ve nothing more to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it your American idea, then, that a church ought to be formed only of
      people socially agreeable together?&rdquo; asked the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no American idea. I am only commenting on facts; but one of them
      is that it is the most difficult thing in the world to reconcile religious
      association with the real or artificial claims of social life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you try much,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morgan, who carried along her
      traditional religious observance with grateful admiration of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Page Morgan had inherited money, and a certain advantageous position
      for observing life and criticising it, humorously sometimes, and without
      any serious intention of disturbing it. He had added to his fair fortune
      by marrying the daintily reared daughter of a cotton-spinner, and he had
      enough to do in attending meetings of directors and looking out for his
      investments to keep him from the operation of the State law regarding
      vagrants, and give greater social weight to his opinions than if he had
      been compelled to work for his maintenance. The Page Morgans had been a
      good deal abroad, and were none the worse Americans for having come in
      contact with the knowledge that there are other peoples who are reasonably
      prosperous and happy without any of our advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, who was always in the conversational
      attitude of wanting to know, &ldquo;that you Americans are disturbed by the
      notion that religion ought to produce social equality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon had the air of conveying the impression that this question was
      settled in England, and that America was interesting on account of
      numerous experiments of this sort. This state of mind was not offensive to
      his interlocutors, because they were accustomed to it in transatlantic
      visitors. Indeed, there was nothing whatever offensive, and little
      defensive, in Mr. John Lyon. What we liked in him, I think, was his simple
      acceptance of a position that required neither explanation nor apology&mdash;a
      social condition that banished a sense of his own personality, and left
      him perfectly free to be absolutely truthful. Though an eldest son and
      next in succession to an earldom, he was still young. Fresh from Oxford
      and South Africa and Australia and British Columbia he had come to study
      the States with a view of perfecting himself for his duties as a
      legislator for the world when he should be called to the House of Peers.
      He did not treat himself like an earl, whatever consciousness he may have
      had that his prospective rank made it safe for him to flirt with the
      various forms of equality abroad in this generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Christianity is expected to produce,&rdquo; Mr. Morgan
      replied, in a meditative way; &ldquo;but I have an idea that the early
      Christians in their assemblies all knew each other, having met elsewhere
      in social intercourse, or, if they were not acquainted, they lost sight of
      distinctions in one paramount interest. But then I don&rsquo;t suppose they were
      exactly civilized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were the Pilgrims and the Puritans?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Fletcher, who now joined
      the talk, in which she had been a most animated and stimulating listener,
      her deep gray eyes dancing with intellectual pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not like to answer &lsquo;no&rsquo; to a descendant of the Mayflower. Yes,
      they were highly civilized. And if we had adhered to their methods, we
      should have avoided a good deal of confusion. The meeting-house, you
      remember, had a committee for seating people according to their quality.
      They were very shrewd, but it had not occurred to them to give the best
      pews to the sitters able to pay the most money for them. They escaped the
      perplexity of reconciling the mercantile and the religious ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fletcher, &ldquo;they got all sorts of people inside
      the same meeting-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and made them feel they were all sorts; but in those, days they were
      not much disturbed by that feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; asked Mr. Lyon, &ldquo;that in this country you have
      churches for the rich and other churches for the poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. We have in the cities rich churches and poor churches, with
      prices of pews according to the means of each sort, and the rich are
      always glad to have the poor come, and if they do not give them the best
      seats, they equalize it by taking up a collection for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lyon,&rdquo; Mrs. Morgan interrupted, &ldquo;you are getting a travesty of the
      whole thing. I don&rsquo;t believe there is elsewhere in the world such a spirit
      of Christian charity as in our churches of all sects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no doubt about the charity; but that doesn&rsquo;t seem to make the
      social machine run any more smoothly in the church associations. I&rsquo;m not
      sure but we shall have to go back to the old idea of considering the
      churches places of worship, and not opportunities for sewing-societies,
      and the cultivation of social equality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found the idea in Rome,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, &ldquo;that the United States is now
      the most promising field for the spread and permanence of the Roman
      Catholic faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; Mr. Fletcher asked, with a smile of Puritan incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A high functionary at the Propaganda gave as a reason that the United
      States is the most democratic country and the Roman Catholic is the most
      democratic religion, having this one notion that all men, high or low, are
      equally sinners and equally in need of one thing only. And I must say that
      in this country I don&rsquo;t find the question of social equality interfering
      much with the work in their churches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because they are not trying to make this world any better, but
      only to prepare for another,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fletcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, we think that the nearer we approach the kingdom-of-heaven idea on
      earth, the better off we shall be hereafter. Is that a modern idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an idea that is giving us a great deal of trouble. We&rsquo;ve got into
      such a sophisticated state that it seems easier to take care of the future
      than of the present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t a very bad doctrine that if you take care of the present,
      the future will take care of itself,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Fletcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; insisted Mr. Morgan; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the modern notion of
      accumulation and compensation&mdash;take care of the pennies and the
      pounds will take care of themselves&mdash;the gospel of Benjamin
      Franklin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; I said, looking up at the entrance of a newcomer, &ldquo;you are just in
      time, Margaret, to give the coup de grace, for it is evident by Mr.
      Morgan&rsquo;s reference, in his Bunker Hill position, to Franklin, that he is
      getting out of powder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood a moment, her slight figure framed in the doorway, while
      the company rose to greet her, with a half-hesitating, half-inquiring look
      in her bright face which I had seen in it a thousand times.

      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      I remember that it came upon me with a sort of surprise at the moment that
      we had never thought or spoken much of Margaret Debree as beautiful. We
      were so accustomed to her; we had known her so long, we had known her
      always. We had never analyzed our admiration of her. She had so many
      qualities that are better than beauty that we had not credited her with
      the more obvious attraction. And perhaps she had just become visibly
      beautiful. It may be that there is an instant in a girl&rsquo;s life
      corresponding to what the Puritans called conversion in the soul, when the
      physical qualities, long maturing, suddenly glow in an effect which we
      call beauty. It cannot be that women do not have a consciousness of it,
      perhaps of the instant of its advent. I remember when I was a child that I
      used to think that a stick of peppermint candy must burn with a
      consciousness of its own deliciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was just turned twenty. As she paused there in the doorway her
      physical perfection flashed upon me for the first time. Of course I do not
      mean perfection, for perfection has no promise in it, rather the sad note
      of limit, and presently recession. In the rounded, exquisite lines of her
      figure there was the promise of that ineffable fullness and delicacy of
      womanhood which all the world raves about and destroys and mourns. It is
      not fulfilled always in the most beautiful, and perhaps never except to
      the woman who loves passionately, and believes she is loved with a
      devotion that exalts her body and soul above every other human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that Margaret&rsquo;s beauty was not classic. Her features were
      irregular even to piquancy. The chin had strength; the mouth was sensitive
      and not too small; the shapely nose with thin nostrils had an assertive
      quality that contradicted the impression of humility in the eyes when
      downcast; the large gray eyes were uncommonly soft and clear, an
      appearance of alternate tenderness and brilliancy as they were veiled or
      uncovered by the long lashes. They were gently commanding eyes, and no
      doubt her most effective point. Her abundant hair, brown with a touch of
      red in it in some lights, fell over her broad forehead in the fashion of
      the time. She had a way of carrying her head, of throwing it back at
      times, that was not exactly imperious, and conveyed the impression of
      spirit rather than of mere vivacity. These details seem to me all
      inadequate and misleading, for the attraction of the face that made it
      interesting is still undefined. I hesitate to say that there was a dimple
      near the corner of her mouth that revealed itself when she smiled lest
      this shall seem mere prettiness, but it may have been the keynote of her
      face. I only knew there was something about it that won the heart, as a
      too conscious or assertive beauty never does. She may have been plain, and
      I may have seen the loveliness of her nature, which I knew well, in
      features that gave less sign of it to strangers. Yet I noticed that Mr.
      Lyon gave her a quick second glance, and his manner was instantly that of
      deference, or at least attention, which he had shown to no other lady in
      the room. And the whimsical idea came into my mind&mdash;we are all so
      warped by international possibilities&mdash;to observe whether she did not
      walk like a countess (that is, as a countess ought to walk) as she
      advanced to shake hands with my wife. It is so easy to turn life into a
      comedy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s great-grandmother&mdash;no, it was her great-great-grandmother,
      but we have kept the Revolutionary period so warm lately that it seems
      near&mdash;was a Newport belle, who married an officer in the suite of
      Rochambeau what time the French defenders of liberty conquered the women
      of Rhode Island. After the war was over, our officer resigned his love of
      glory for the heart of one of the loveliest women and the care of the best
      plantation on the Island. I have seen a miniature of her, which her lover
      wore at Yorktown, and which he always swore that Washington coveted&mdash;a
      miniature painted by a wandering artist of the day, which entirely
      justifies the French officer in his abandonment of the trade of a soldier.
      Such is man in his best estate. A charming face can make him campaign and
      fight and slay like a demon, can make a coward of him, can fill him with
      ambition to win the world, and can tame him into the domesticity of a
      drawing-room cat. There is this noble capacity in man to respond to the
      divinest thing visible to him in this world. Etienne Debree became, I
      believe, a very good citizen of the republic, and in &lsquo;93 used occasionally
      to shake his head with satisfaction to find that it was still on his
      shoulders. I am not sure that he ever visited Mount Vernon, but after
      Washington&rsquo;s death Debree&rsquo;s intimacy with our first President became a
      more and more important part of his life and conversation. There is a
      pleasant tradition that Lafayette, when he was here in 1784, embraced the
      young bride in the French manner, and that this salute was valued as a
      sort of heirloom in the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      I always thought that Margaret inherited her New England conscience from
      her great-great-grandmother, and a certain esprit or gayety&mdash;that is,
      a sub-gayety which was never frivolity&mdash;from her French ancestor. Her
      father and mother had died when she was ten years old, and she had been
      reared by a maiden aunt, with whom she still lived. The combined fortunes
      of both required economy, and after Margaret had passed her school course
      she added to their resources by teaching in a public school. I remember
      that she taught history, following, I suppose, the American notion that
      any one can teach history who has a text-book, just as he or she can teach
      literature with the same help. But it happened that Margaret was a better
      teacher than many, because she had not learned history in school, but in
      her father&rsquo;s well-selected library.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little stir at Margaret&rsquo;s entrance; Mr. Lyon was introduced to
      her, and my wife, with that subtle feeling for effect which women have,
      slightly changed the lights. Perhaps Margaret&rsquo;s complexion or her black
      dress made this readjustment necessary to the harmony of the room. Perhaps
      she felt the presence of a different temperament in the little circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never can tell exactly what it is that guides her in regard to the
      influence of light and color upon the intercourse of people, upon their
      conversation, making it take one cast or another. Men are susceptible to
      these influences, but it is women alone who understand how to produce
      them. And a woman who has not this subtle feeling always lacks charm,
      however intellectual she may be; I always think of her as sitting in the
      glare of disenchanting sunlight as indifferent to the exposure as a man
      would be. I know in a general way that a sunset light induces one kind of
      talk and noonday light another, and I have learned that talk always
      brightens up with the addition of a fresh crackling stick to the fire. I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have known how to change the lights for Margaret, although I
      think I had as distinct an impression of her personality as had my wife.
      There was nothing disturbing in it; indeed, I never saw her otherwise than
      serene, even when her voice betrayed strong emotion. The quality that
      impressed me most, however, was her sincerity, coupled with intellectual
      courage and clearness that had almost the effect of brilliancy, though I
      never thought of her as a brilliant woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mischief have you been attempting, Mr. Morgan?&rdquo; asked Margaret, as
      she took a chair near him. &ldquo;Were you trying to make Mr. Lyon comfortable
      by dragging in Bunker Hill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that was Mr. Fairchild, in his capacity as host.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure you needn&rsquo;t mind me,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, good-humoredly. &ldquo;I
      landed in Boston, and the first thing I went to see was the Monument. It
      struck me as so odd, you know, that the Americans should begin life by
      celebrating their first defeat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is our way,&rdquo; replied Margaret, quickly. &ldquo;We have started on a new
      basis over here; we win by losing. He who loses his life shall find it. If
      the red slayer thinks he slays he is mistaken. You know the Southerners
      say that they surrendered at last simply because they got tired of beating
      the North.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How odd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Debree simply means,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;that we have inherited from the
      English an inability to know when we are whipped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we were not fighting the battle of Bunker Hill, or fighting about it,
      which is more serious, Miss Debree. What I wanted to ask you was whether
      you think the domestication of religion will affect its power in the
      regulation of conduct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Domestication? You are too deep for me, Mr. Morgan. I don&rsquo;t any more
      understand you than I comprehend the writers who write about the
      feminization of literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, taking the mystery out of it, the predominant element of worship,
      making the churches sort of good-will charitable associations for the
      spread of sociability and good-feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean making Christianity practical?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partially that. It is a part of the general problem of what women are
      going to make of the world, now they have got hold of it, or are getting
      hold of it, and are discontented with being women, or with being treated
      as women, and are bringing their emotions into all the avocations of
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot make it any worse than it has been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of that. Robustness is needed in churches as much as in
      government. I don&rsquo;t know how much the cause of religion is advanced by
      these church clubs of Christian Endeavor if that is the name, associations
      of young boys and girls who go about visiting other like clubs in a
      sufficiently hilarious manner. I suppose it&rsquo;s the spirit of the age. I&rsquo;m
      just wondering whether the world is getting to think more of having a good
      time than it is of salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think woman&rsquo;s influence&mdash;for you cannot mean anything else&mdash;is
      somehow taking the vigor out of affairs, making even the church a soft,
      purring affair, reducing us all to what I suppose you would call a mush of
      domesticity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or femininity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the world has been brutal enough; it had better try a little
      femininity now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will not be more cruel to women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not an argument; that is a stab. I fancy you are altogether
      skeptical about woman. Do you believe in her education?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to a certain point, or rather, I should say, after a certain point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; spoke up my wife, shading her eyes from the fire with a fan.
      &ldquo;I begin to have my doubts about education as a panacea. I&rsquo;ve noticed that
      girls with only a smattering&mdash;and most of them in the nature of
      things can go, no further&mdash;are more liable to temptations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because &lsquo;education&rsquo; is mistaken for the giving of information
      without training, as we are finding out in England,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or that it is dangerous to awaken the imagination without a heavy ballast
      of principle,&rdquo; said Mr. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a beautiful sentiment,&rdquo; Margaret exclaimed, throwing back her
      head, with a flash from her eyes. &ldquo;That ought to shut out women entirely.
      Only I cannot see how teaching women what men know is going to give them
      any less principle than men have. It has seemed to me a long while that
      the time has come for treating women like human beings, and giving them
      the responsibility of their position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you want, Margaret?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly what I do want,&rdquo; she answered, sinking back in her
      chair, sincerity coming to modify her enthusiasm. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go to
      Congress, or be a sheriff, or a lawyer, or a locomotive engineer. I want
      the freedom of my own being, to be interested in everything in the world,
      to feel its life as men do. You don&rsquo;t know what it is to have an inferior
      person condescend to you simply because he is a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you wish to be treated as a woman?&rdquo; queried Mr. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Do you think I want to banish romance out of the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, my dear,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;The only thing that makes society
      any better than an industrial ant-hill is the love between women and men,
      blind and destructive as it often is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morgan, rising to go, &ldquo;having got back to first
      principles&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it is best to take your husband home before he denies even
      them,&rdquo; Mr. Morgan added.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the others had gone, Margaret sat by the fire, musing, as if no one
      else were in the room. The Englishman, still alert and eager for
      information, regarded her with growing interest. It came into my mind as
      odd that, being such an uninteresting people as we are, the English should
      be so curious about us. After an interval, Mr. Lyon said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Debree, but would you mind telling me whether the
      movement of Women&rsquo;s Rights is gaining in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Lyon,&rdquo; Margaret replied, after a pause, with a
      look of weariness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of all the talk about it. I wish men and
      women, every soul of them, would try to make the most of themselves, and
      see what would come of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in some places they vote about schools, and you have conventions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever attend any kind of convention yourself, Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? No. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. Neither did I. But you have a right to, you know. I should
      like to ask you one question, Mr. Lyon,&rdquo; the girl, continued, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should be most obliged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it that so few English women marry Americans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I never thought of that,&rdquo; he stammered, reddening. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps
      it&rsquo;s because of American women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Margaret, with a little courtesy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice of you
      to say that. I can begin to see now why so many American women marry
      Englishmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman blushed still more, and Margaret said good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite evident the next day that Margaret had made an impression on
      our visitor, and that he was struggling with some new idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say, Mrs. Fairchild,&rdquo; he asked my wife, &ldquo;that Miss Debree is a
      teacher? It seems very odd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I said she taught in one of our schools. I don&rsquo;t think she is exactly
      a teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not intending always to teach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she has any definite intentions, but I never think of her
      as a teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so bright, and&mdash;and interesting, don&rsquo;t you think? So
      American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Miss Debree is one of the exceptions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that all American women were as clever as Miss Debree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said my wife. And Mr. Lyon looked as if he couldn&rsquo;t see why
      she should thank him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottage in which Margaret lived with her aunt, Miss Forsythe, was not
      far from our house. In summer it was very pretty, with its vine-shaded
      veranda across the front; and even in winter, with the inevitable
      raggedness of deciduous vines, it had an air of refinement, a promise
      which the cheerful interior more than fulfilled. Margaret&rsquo;s parting word
      to my wife the night before had been that she thought her aunt would like
      to see the &ldquo;chrysalis earl,&rdquo; and as Mr. Lyon had expressed a desire to see
      something more of what he called the &ldquo;gentry&rdquo; of New England, my wife
      ended their afternoon walk at Miss Forsythe&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the winter days which are rare in New England, but of which
      there had been a succession all through the Christmas holidays. Snow had
      not yet come, all the earth was brown and frozen, whichever way you looked
      the interlacing branches and twigs of the trees made a delicate lace-work,
      the sky was gray-blue, and the low-sailing sun had just enough heat to
      evoke moisture from the frosty ground and suffuse the atmosphere into
      softness, in which all the landscape became poetic. The phenomenon known
      as &ldquo;red sunsets&rdquo; was faintly repeated in the greenish crimson glow along
      the violet hills, in which Venus burned like a jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fire smoldering on the hearth in the room they entered, which
      seemed to be sitting-room, library, parlor, all in one; the old table of
      oak, too substantial for ornament, was strewn with late periodicals and
      pamphlets&mdash;English, American, and French&mdash;and with books which
      lay unarranged as they were thrown down from recent reading. In the centre
      was a bunch of red roses in a pale-blue Granada jug. Miss Forsythe rose
      from a seat in the western window, with a book in her hand, to greet her
      callers. She was slender, like Margaret, but taller, with soft brown eyes
      and hair streaked with gray, which, sweeping plainly aside from her
      forehead in a fashion then antiquated, contrasted finely with the flush of
      pink in her cheeks. This flush did not suggest youth, but rather ripeness,
      the tone that comes with the lines made in the face by gentle acceptance
      of the inevitable in life. In her quiet and self-possessed manner there
      was a little note of graceful timidity, not perhaps noticeable in itself,
      but in contrast with that unmistakable air of confidence which a woman
      married always has, and which in the unrefined becomes assertive, an
      exaggerated notion of her importance, of the value added to her opinions
      by the act of marriage. You can see it in her air the moment she walks
      away from the altar, keeping step to Mendelssohn&rsquo;s tune. Jack Sharpley
      says that she always seems to be saying, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve done it once for
      all.&rdquo; This assumption of the married must be one of the hardest things for
      single women to bear in their self-congratulating sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have no doubt that Georgiana Forsythe was a charming girl, spirited and
      handsome; for the beauty of her years, almost pathetic in its dignity and
      self-renunciation, could not have followed mere prettiness or a
      commonplace experience. What that had been I never inquired, but it had
      not soured her. She was not communicative nor confidential, I fancy, with
      any one, but she was always friendly and sympathetic to the trouble of
      others, and helpful in an undemonstrative way. If she herself had a secret
      feeling that her life was a failure, it never impressed her friends so, it
      was so even, and full of good offices and quiet enjoyment. Heaven only
      knows, however, the pathos of this apparently undisturbed life. For did a
      woman ever live who would not give all the years of tasteless serenity,
      for one year, for one month, for one hour, of the uncalculating delirium
      of love poured out upon a man who returned it? It may be better for the
      world that there are these women to whom life has still some mysteries,
      who are capable of illusions and the sweet sentimentality that grows out
      of a romance unrealized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the recent books were on Miss Forsythe&rsquo;s table, her tastes and
      culture were of the past age. She admired Emerson and Tennyson. One may
      keep current with the news of the world without changing his principles. I
      imagine that Miss Forsythe read without injury to herself the passionate
      and the pantheistic novels of the young women who have come forward in
      these days of emancipation to teach their grandmothers a new basis of
      morality, and to render meaningless all the consoling epitaphs on the
      mossy New England gravestones. She read Emerson for his sweet spirit, for
      his belief in love and friendship, her simple Congregationalist faith
      remaining undisturbed by his philosophy, from which she took only a habit
      of toleration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Debree has gone to church,&rdquo; she said, in answer to Mr. Lyon&rsquo;s glance
      around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To vespers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe they call it that. Our evening meetings, you know, only begin
      at early candlelight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do not belong to the Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, to the ancient aristocratic church of colonial times,&rdquo; she
      replied, with a little smile of amusement. &ldquo;My niece has stepped off
      Plymouth Rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was your religion founded on Plymouth Rock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My niece says so when I rally her deserting the faith of her fathers,&rdquo;
       replied Miss Forsythe, laughing at the working of the Episcopalian mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to understand about that; I mean about the position of
      Dissenters in America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I could not help you, Mr. Lyon. I fancy an Englishman would
      have to be born again, as the phrase used to be, to comprehend that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Lyon was still unsatisfied on this point, he found the
      conversation shifted to the other side. Perhaps it was a new experience to
      him that women should lead and not follow in conversation. At any rate, it
      was an experience that put him at his ease. Miss Forsythe was a great
      admirer of Gladstone and of General Gordon, and she expressed her
      admiration with a knowledge that showed she had read the English
      newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I confess I don&rsquo;t comprehend Gladstone&rsquo;s conduct with regard to Egypt
      and Gordon&rsquo;s relief,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; interposed my wife, &ldquo;it would have been better for Gordon if he
      had trusted Providence more and Gladstone less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was Gladstone&rsquo;s humanity that made him hesitate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To bombard Alexandria?&rdquo; asked Mr. Lyon, with a look of asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a mistake to be expected of a Tory, but not of Mr. Gladstone,
      who seems always seeking the broadest principles of justice in his
      statesmanship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we regard Mr. Gladstone as a very great man, Miss Forsythe. He is
      broad enough. You know we consider him a rhetorical phenomenon.
      Unfortunately he always &lsquo;muffs&rsquo; anything he touches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspected,&rdquo; Miss Forsythe replied, after a moment, &ldquo;that party spirit
      ran as high in England as it does with us, and is as personal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon disclaimed any personal feeling, and the talk drifted into a
      comparison of English and American politics, mainly with reference to the
      social factor in English politics, which is so little an element here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of the talk Margaret came in. The brisk walk in the rosy
      twilight had heightened her color, and given her a glowing expression
      which her face had not the night before, and a tenderness and softness, an
      unworldliness, brought from the quiet hour in the church.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          &ldquo;My lady comes at last,
          Timid and stepping fast,
          And hastening hither,
          Her modest eyes downcast.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She greeted the stranger with a Puritan undemonstrativeness, and as if not
      exactly aware of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have gone to vespers if I had known,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon,
      after an embarrassing pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; asked the girl, still abstractedly. &ldquo;The world seems in a vesper
      mood,&rdquo; she added, looking out the west windows at the red sky and the
      evening star.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth Nature herself at the moment suggested that talk was an
      impertinence. The callers rose to go, with an exchange of neighborhood
      friendliness and invitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, as they walked homeward, &ldquo;what the New
      World was like.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon&rsquo;s invitation was for a week. Before the end of the week I was
      called to New York to consult Mr. Henderson in regard to a railway
      investment in the West, which was turning out more permanent than
      profitable. Rodney Henderson&mdash;the name later became very familiar to
      the public in connection with a certain Congressional investigation&mdash;was
      a graduate of my own college, a New Hampshire boy, a lawyer by profession,
      who practiced, as so many American lawyers do, in Wall Street, in
      political combinations, in Washington, in railways. He was already known
      as a rising man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned Mr. Lyon was still at our house. I understood that my wife
      had persuaded him to extend his visit&mdash;a proposal he was little
      reluctant to fall in with, so interested had he become in studying social
      life in America. I could well comprehend this, for we are all making a
      &ldquo;study&rdquo; of something in this age, simple enjoyment being considered an
      unworthy motive. I was glad to see that the young Englishman was improving
      himself, broadening his knowledge of life, and not wasting the golden
      hours of youth. Experience is what we all need, and though love or
      love-making cannot be called a novelty, there is something quite fresh
      about the study of it in the modern spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon had made himself very agreeable to the little circle, not less by
      his inquiring spirit than by his unaffected manners, by a kind of
      simplicity which women recognize as unconscious, the result of an
      inherited habit of not thinking about one&rsquo;s position. In excess it may be
      very disagreeable, but when it is combined with genuine good-nature and no
      self-assertion, it is attractive. And although American women like a man
      who is aggressive towards the world and combative, there is the delight of
      novelty in one who has leisure to be agreeable, leisure for them, and who
      seems to their imagination to have a larger range in life than those who
      are driven by business&mdash;one able to offer the peace and security of
      something attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been several little neighborhood entertainments, dinners at the
      Morgans&rsquo; and at Mrs. Fletcher&rsquo;s, and an evening cup of tea at Miss
      Forsythe&rsquo;s. In fact Margaret and Mr. Lyon had been thrown much together.
      He had accompanied her to vespers, and they had taken a wintry walk or two
      together before the snow came. My wife had not managed it&mdash;she
      assured me of that; but she had not felt authorized to interfere; and she
      had visited the public library and looked into the British Peerage. Men
      were so suspicious. Margaret was quite able to take care of herself. I
      admitted that, but I suggested that the Englishman was a stranger in a
      strange land, that he was far from home, and had perhaps a weakened sense
      of those powerful social influences which must, after all, control him in
      the end. The only response to this was, &ldquo;I think, dear, you&rsquo;d better wrap
      him up in cotton and send him back to his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among her other activities Margaret was interested in a mission school in
      the city, to which she devoted an occasional evening and Sunday
      afternoons. This was a new surprise for Mr. Lyon. Was this also a part of
      the restlessness of American life? At Mrs. Howe&rsquo;s german the other evening
      the girl had seemed wholly absorbed in dress, and the gayety of the
      serious formality of the occasion, feeling the responsibility of it
      scarcely less than the &ldquo;leader.&rdquo; Yet her mind was evidently much occupied
      with the &ldquo;condition of women,&rdquo; and she taught in a public school. He could
      not at all make it out. Was she any more serious about the german than
      about the mission school? It seemed odd at her age to take life so
      seriously. And was she serious in all her various occupations, or only
      experimenting? There was a certain mocking humor in the girl that puzzled
      the Englishman still more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not seen much of your life,&rdquo; he said one night to Mr. Morgan; &ldquo;but
      aren&rsquo;t most American women a little restless, seeking an occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they have that appearance; but about the same number find it, as
      formerly, in marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean, you know, do they look to marriage as an end so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that they ever did look to marriage as anything but a
      means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you, Mr. Lyon,&rdquo; my wife interrupted, &ldquo;you will get no
      information out of Mr. Morgan; he is a scoffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, I do assure you,&rdquo; Morgan replied. &ldquo;I am just a humble
      observer. I see that there is a change going on, but I cannot comprehend
      it. When I was young, girls used to go in for society; they danced their
      feet off from seventeen to twenty-one. I never heard anything about any
      occupation; they had their swing and their fling, and their flirtations;
      they appeared to be skimming off of those impressionable, joyous years the
      cream of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that fitted them for the seriousness of life?&rdquo; asked his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am under the impression that very good women came out of that
      society. I got one out of that dancing crowd who has been serious enough
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And little enough you have profited by it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morgan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m content. But probably I&rsquo;m old-fashioned. There is quite another
      spirit now. Girls out of pinafores must begin seriously to consider some
      calling. All their flirtation from seventeen to twenty-one is with some
      occupation. All their dancing days they must go to college, or in some way
      lay the foundation for a useful life. I suppose it&rsquo;s all right. No doubt
      we shall have a much higher style of women in the future than we ever had
      in the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You allow nothing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fletcher, &ldquo;for the necessity of earning a
      living in these days of competition. Women never will come to their proper
      position in the world, even as companions of men, which you regard as
      their highest office, until they have the ability to be self-supporting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I admitted the fact of the independence of women a long time ago.
      Every one does that before he comes to middle life. About the shifting all
      round of this burden of earning a living, I am not so sure. It does not
      appear yet to make competition any less; perhaps competition would
      disappear if everybody did earn his own living and no more. I wonder,
      by-the-way, if the girls, the young women, of the class we seem to be
      discussing ever do earn as much as would pay the wages of the servants who
      are hired to do the housework in their places?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a most ignoble suggestion,&rdquo; I could not help saying, &ldquo;when you
      know that the object in modern life is the cultivation of the mind, the
      elevation of women, and men also, in intellectual life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. I should like to have asked Abigail Adams&rsquo;s opinion on the
      way to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that you didn&rsquo;t know that the spinning-jenny
      and the stocking-knitter had been invented. Given these, the women&rsquo;s
      college was a matter of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a believer in all kinds of machinery anything to save labor.
      Only, I have faith that neither the jenny nor the college will change
      human nature, nor take the romance out of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said my wife. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard two things affirmed: that women who
      receive a scientific or professional education lose their faith, become
      usually agnostics, having lost sensitiveness to the mysteries of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think, therefore, that they should not have a scientific
      education?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, unless all scientific prying into things is a mistake. Women may be
      more likely at first to be upset than men, but they will recover their
      balance when the novelty is worn off. No amount of science will entirely
      change their emotional nature; and besides, with all our science, I don&rsquo;t
      see that the supernatural has any less hold on this generation than on the
      former.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and you might say the world was never before so credulous as it is
      now. But what was the other thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that co-education is likely to diminish marriages among the
      co-educated. Daily familiarity in the classroom at the most impressionable
      age, revelation of all the intellectual weaknesses and petulances,
      absorption of mental routine on an equality, tend to destroy the sense of
      romance and mystery that are the most powerful attractions between the
      sexes. It is a sort of disenchanting familiarity that rubs off the bloom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any statistics on the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I fancy it is only a notion of some old fogy who thinks education in
      any form is dangerous for women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I fancy that co-education will have about as much effect on life
      generally as that solemn meeting of a society of intelligent and
      fashionable women recently in one of our great cities, who met to discuss
      the advisability of limiting population.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;this is an interesting age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was less anxious about the vagaries of it when I saw the very
      old-fashioned way in which the international drama was going on in our
      neighborhood. Mr. Lyon was increasingly interested in Margaret&rsquo;s mission
      work. Nor was there much affectation in this. Philanthropy, anxiety about
      the working-classes, is nowhere more serious or in the fashion than it is
      in London. Mr. Lyon, wherever he had been, had made a special study of the
      various aid and relief societies, especially of the work for young waifs
      and strays.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday afternoon they were returning from the Bloom Street Mission.
      Snow covered the ground, the sky was leaden, and the air had a penetrating
      chill in it far more disagreeable than extreme cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We also,&rdquo; Mr. Lyon was saying, in continuation of a conversation, &ldquo;are
      making a great effort for the common people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t any common people here,&rdquo; replied Margaret, quickly. &ldquo;That
      bright boy you noticed in my class, who was a terror six months ago, will
      no doubt be in the City Council in a few years, and likely enough mayor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know your theory. It practically comes to the same thing, whatever
      you call it. I couldn&rsquo;t see that the work in New York differed much from
      that in London. We who have leisure ought to do something for the
      working-classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes doubt if it is not all a mistake most of our charitable work.
      The thing is to get people to do something for themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot do away with distinctions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not, so long as so many people are born vicious, or
      incompetent, or lazy. But, Mr. Lyon, how much good do you suppose
      condescending charity does?&rdquo; asked Margaret, firing up in a way the girl
      had at times. &ldquo;I mean the sort that makes the distinctions more evident.
      The very fact that you have leisure to meddle in their affairs may be an
      annoyance to the folks you try to help by the little palliatives of
      charity. What effect upon a wretched city neighborhood do you suppose is
      produced by the advent in it of a stylish carriage and a lady in silk, or
      even the coming of a well-dressed, prosperous woman in a horse-car,
      however gentle and unassuming she may be in this distribution of sympathy
      and bounty? Isn&rsquo;t the feeling of inequality intensified? And the degrading
      part of it may be that so many are willing to accept this sort of bounty.
      And your men of leisure, your club men, sitting in the windows and seeing
      the world go by as a spectacle-men who never did an hour&rsquo;s necessary work
      in their lives&mdash;what effect do you suppose the sight of them has upon
      men out of work, perhaps by their own fault, owing to the same disposition
      to be idle that the men in the club windows have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think it would be any better if all were poor alike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be better if there were no idle people. I&rsquo;m half ashamed
      that I have leisure to go every time I go to that mission. And I&rsquo;m almost
      sorry, Mr. Lyon, that I took you there. The boys knew you were English.
      One of them asked me if you were a &lsquo;lord&rsquo; or a &lsquo;juke&rsquo; or something. I
      cannot tell how they will take it. They may resent the spying into their
      world of an &lsquo;English juke,&rsquo; and they may take it in the light of a show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon laughed. And then, perhaps after a little reflection upon the
      possibility that the nobility was becoming a show in this world, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to think I&rsquo;m very unfortunate, Miss Debree. You seem to remind me
      that I am in a position in which I can do very little to help the world
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. You can do very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how, when whatever I attempt is considered a condescension? What can
      I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; and Margaret turned her eyes frankly upon him. &ldquo;You can be a
      good earl when your time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their way lay through the little city park. It is a pretty place in summer&mdash;a
      varied surface, well planted with forest and ornamental trees, intersected
      by a winding stream. The little river was full now, and ice had formed on
      it, with small openings here and there, where the dark water, hurrying
      along as if in fear of arrest, had a more chilling aspect than the icy
      cover. The ground was white with snow, and all the trees were bare except
      for a few frozen oak-leaves here and there, which shivered in the wind and
      somehow added to the desolation. Leaden clouds covered the sky, and only
      in the west was there a gleam of the departing winter day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the elevated bank of the stream, opposite to the road by which they
      approached, they saw a group of people&mdash;perhaps twenty-drawn closely
      together, either in the sympathy of segregation from an unfeeling world,
      or for protection from the keen wind. On the hither bank, and leaning on
      the rails of the drive, had collected a motley crowd of spectators, men,
      women, and boys, who exhibited some impatience and much curiosity,
      decorous for the most part, but emphasized by occasional jocose remarks in
      an undertone. A serious ceremony was evidently in progress. The separate
      group had not a prosperous air. The women were thinly clad for such a day.
      Conspicuous in the little assembly was a tall, elderly man in a shabby
      long coat and a broad felt hat, from under which his white hair fell upon
      his shoulders. He might be a prophet in Israel come out to testify to an
      unbelieving world, and the little group around him, shaken like reeds in
      the wind, had the appearance of martyrs to a cause. The light of another
      world shone in their thin, patient faces. Come, they seemed to say to the
      worldlings on the opposite bank&mdash;come and see what happiness it is to
      serve the Lord. As they waited, a faint tune was started, a quavering
      hymn, whose feeble notes the wind blew away of first, but which grew
      stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the first stanza was finished a carriage appeared in the rear of
      the group. From it descended a middle-aged man and a stout woman, and they
      together helped a young girl to alight. She was clad all in white. For a
      moment her thin, delicate figure shrank from the cutting wind. Timid,
      nervous, she glanced an instant at the crowd and the dark icy stream; but
      it was only a protest of the poor body; the face had the rapt, exultant
      look of joyous sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall man advanced to meet her, and led her into the midst of the
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments there was prayer, inaudible at a distance. Then the tall
      man, taking the girl by the hand, advanced down the slope to the stream.
      His hat was laid aside, his venerable locks streamed in the breeze, his
      eyes were turned to heaven; the girl walked as in a vision, without a
      tremor, her wide-opened eyes fixed upon invisible things. As they moved
      on, the group behind set up a joyful hymn in a kind of mournful chant, in
      which the tall man joined with a strident voice. Fitfully the words came
      on the wind, in an almost heart-breaking wail:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Beyond the smiling and the weeping I shall be soon;
   Beyond the waking and the sleeping,
   Beyond the sowing and the reaping, I shall be soon.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      They were near the water now, and the tall man&rsquo;s voice sounded out loud
      and clear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, tarry not, but come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were entering the stream where there was an opening clear of ice; the
      footing was not very secure, and the tall man ceased singing, but the
      little band sang on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Beyond the blooming and the fading I shall be soon.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The girl grew paler and shuddered. The tall man sustained her with an
      attitude of infinite sympathy, and seemed to speak words of encouragement.
      They were in the mid-stream; the cold flood surged about their waists. The
      group sang on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Beyond the shining and the shading,
   Beyond the hoping and the dreading, I shall be soon.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The strong, tender arms of the tall man gently lowered the white form
      under the cruel water; he staggered a moment in the swift stream,
      recovered himself, raised her, white as death, and the voices of the
      wailing tune came:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Love, rest, and home
   Sweet hope! Lord, tarry not, but come!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the tall man, as he struggled to the shore with his almost insensible
      burden, could be heard above the other voices and the wind and the rush of
      the waters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Lord, tarry not, but come!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The girl was hurried into the carriage, and the group quickly dispersed.
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rdquo; The tender-hearted little wife of the rough man in
      the crowd who began that sentence did not permit him to finish it.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be a case for a doctor right away,&rdquo; remarked a well-known
      practitioner who had been looking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Mr. Lyon walked home in silence. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about it,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a pitiful world.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      In the evening, at our house, Margaret described the scene in the park.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful,&rdquo; was the comment of Miss Forsythe. &ldquo;The authorities ought
      not to permit such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seemed to me as heroic as pitiful, aunt. I fear I should be incapable
      of making such a testimony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it was so unnecessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do we know what is necessary to any poor soul? What impressed me most
      strongly was that there is in the world still this longing to suffer
      physically and endure public scorn for a belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may have been a disappointment to the little band,&rdquo; said Mr. Morgan,
      &ldquo;that there was no demonstration from the spectators, that there was no
      loud jeering, that no snowballs were thrown by the boys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They could hardly expect that,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the world has become so tolerant
      that it doesn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think,&rdquo; Margaret replied, &ldquo;that the spectators for a moment came
      under the spell of the hour, and were awed by something supernatural in
      the endurance of that frail girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said my wife, after a little pause. &ldquo;I believe that there is
      as much sense of mystery in the world as ever, and as much of what we call
      faith, only it shows itself eccentrically. Breaking away from traditions
      and not going to church have not destroyed the need in the minds of the
      mass of people for something outside themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I tell you,&rdquo; interposed Morgan&mdash;&ldquo;it is almost in the line of
      your thought&mdash;of a girl I met the other day on the train? I happened
      to be her seat-mate in the car-thin face, slight little figure&mdash;a
      commonplace girl, whom I took at first to be not more than twenty, but
      from the lines about her large eyes she was probably nearer forty. She had
      in her lap a book, which she conned from time to time, and seemed to be
      committing verses to memory as she looked out the window. At last I
      ventured to ask what literature it was that interested her so much, when
      she turned and frankly entered into conversation. It was a little Advent
      song-book. She liked to read it on the train, and hum over the tunes. Yes,
      she was a good deal on the cars; early every morning she rode thirty miles
      to her work, and thirty miles back every evening. Her work was that of
      clerk and copyist in a freight office, and she earned nine dollars a week,
      on which she supported herself and her mother. It was hard work, but she
      did not mind it much. Her mother was quite feeble. She was an Adventist.
      &lsquo;And you?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Oh, yes; I am. I&rsquo;ve been an Adventist twenty years,
      and I&rsquo;ve been perfectly happy ever since I joined&mdash;perfectly,&rsquo; she
      added, turning her plain face, now radiant, towards me. &lsquo;Are you one?&rsquo; she
      asked, presently. &lsquo;Not an immediate Adventist,&rsquo; I was obliged to confess.
      &lsquo;I thought you might be, there are so many now, more and more.&rsquo; I learned
      that in our little city there were two Advent societies; there had been a
      split on account of some difference in the meaning of original sin. &lsquo;And
      you are not discouraged by the repeated failure of the predictions of the
      end of the world?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;No. Why should we be? We don&rsquo;t fix any
      certain day now, but all the signs show that it is very near. We are all
      free to think as we like. Most of our members now think it will be next
      year.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I hope not!&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; she asked, turning to me
      with a look of surprise. &lsquo;Are you afraid?&rsquo; I evaded by saying that I
      supposed the good had nothing to fear. &lsquo;Then you must be an Adventist, you
      have so much sympathy.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to have the world come to
      an end next year, because there are so many interesting problems, and I
      want to see how they will be worked out.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;How can you want to put
      it off&rsquo;&mdash;and there was for the first time a little note of fanaticism
      in her voice&mdash;&lsquo;when there is so much poverty and hard work? It is
      such a hard world, and so much suffering and sin. And it could all be
      ended in a moment. How can you want it to go on?&rsquo; The train approached the
      station, and she rose to say good-by. &lsquo;You will see the truth some day,&rsquo; 
      she said, and went away as cheerful as if the world was actually
      destroyed. She was the happiest woman I have seen in a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it is an age of both faith and credulity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing marks it more,&rdquo; Morgan added, &ldquo;than the popular expectation
      among the scientific and the ignorant of something to come out of the
      dimly understood relation of body and mind. It is like the expectation of
      the possibilities of electricity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going on to say,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that wherever I walk in the city of
      a Sunday afternoon, I am struck with the number of little meetings going
      on, of the faithful and the unfaithful, Adventists, socialists,
      spiritualists, culturists, Sons and Daughters of Edom; from all the open
      windows of the tall buildings come notes of praying, of exhortation, the
      melancholy wail of the inspiring Sankey tunes, total abstinence melodies,
      over-the-river melodies, songs of entreaty, and songs of praise. There is
      so much going on outside of the regular churches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the churches are well attended,&rdquo; suggested my wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, fairly, at least once a day, and if there is sensational preaching,
      twice. But there is nothing that will so pack the biggest hall in the city
      as the announcement of inspirational preaching by some young woman who
      speaks at random on a text given her when she steps upon the platform.
      There is something in her rhapsody, even when it is incoherent, that
      appeals to a prevailing spirit.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much of it is curiosity?&rdquo; Morgan asked. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the hall just as
      jammed when the clever attorney of Nothingism, Ham Saversoul, jokes about
      the mysteries of this life and the next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. People like the emotional and the amusing. All the same,
      they are credulous, and entertain doubt and belief on the slightest
      evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it natural,&rdquo; spoke up Mr. Lyon, who had hitherto been silent, &ldquo;that
      you should drift into this condition without an established church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s natural,&rdquo; Morgan retorted, &ldquo;that people dissatisfied with an
      established religion should drift over here. Great Britain, you know, is a
      famous recruiting-ground for our socialistic experiments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;men will have something. If what is established
      repels to the extent of getting itself disestablished, and all churches
      should be broken up, society would somehow precipitate itself again
      spiritually. I heard the other day that Boston, getting a little weary of
      the Vedas, was beginning to take up the New Testament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;since Tolstoi mentioned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a little the talk drifted into psychic research, and got lost in
      stories of &ldquo;appearances&rdquo; and &ldquo;long-distance&rdquo; communications. It appeared
      to me that intelligent people accepted this sort of story as true on
      evidence on which they wouldn&rsquo;t risk five dollars if it were a question of
      money. Even scientists swallow tales of prehistoric bones on testimony
      they would reject if it involved the title to a piece of real estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon still lingered in the lap of a New England winter as if it had
      been Capua. He was anxious to visit Washington and study the politics of
      the country, and see the sort of society produced in the freedom of a
      republic, where there was no court to give the tone and there were no
      class lines to determine position. He was restless under this sense of
      duty. The future legislator for the British Empire must understand the
      Constitution of its great rival, and thus be able to appreciate the social
      currents that have so much to do with political action.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact he had another reason for uneasiness. His mother had written him,
      asking why he stayed so long in an unimportant city, he who had been so
      active a traveler hitherto. Knowledge of the capitals was what he needed.
      Agreeable people he could find at home, if his only object was to pass the
      time. What could he reply? Could he say that he had become very much
      interested in studying a schoolteacher&mdash;a very charming
      school-teacher? He could see the vision raised in the minds of his mother
      and of the earl and of his elder sister as they should read this precious
      confession&mdash;a vision of a schoolma&rsquo;am, of an American girl, and an
      American girl without any money at that, moving in the little orbit of
      Chisholm House. The thing was absurd. And yet why was it absurd? What was
      English politics, what was Chisholm House, what was everybody in England
      compared to this noble girl? Nay, what would the world be without her? He
      grew hot in thinking of it, indignant at his relations and the whole
      artificial framework of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was almost humiliating. He began, to doubt the stability of
      his own position. Hitherto he had met no obstacle: whatever he had desired
      he had obtained. He was a sensible fellow, and knew the world was not made
      for him; but it certainly had yielded to him in everything. Why did he
      doubt now? That he did doubt showed him the intensity of his interest in
      Margaret. For love is humble, and undervalues self in contrast with that
      which it desires. At this touchstone rank, fortune, all that go with them,
      seemed poor. What were all these to a woman&rsquo;s soul? But there were women
      enough, women enough in England, women more beautiful than Margaret,
      doubtless as amiable and intellectual. Yet now there was for him only one
      woman in the world. And Margaret showed no sign. Was he about to make a
      fool of himself? If she should reject him he would seem a fool to himself.
      If she accepted him he would seem a fool to the whole circle that made his
      world at home. The situation was intolerable. He would end it by going.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not go. If he went today he could not see her tomorrow. To a
      lover anything can be borne if he knows that he shall see her tomorrow. In
      short, he could not go so long as there was any doubt about her
      disposition towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a man is still reduced to this in the latter part of the nineteenth
      century, notwithstanding all our science, all our analysis of the passion,
      all our wise jabber about the failure of marriage, all our commonsense
      about the relation of the sexes. Love is still a personal question, not to
      be reasoned about or in any way disposed of except in the old way. Maidens
      dream about it; diplomats yield to it; stolid men are upset by it; the
      aged become young, the young grave, under its influence; the student loses
      his appetite&mdash;God bless him! I like to hear the young fellows at the
      club rattle on bravely, indifferent to the whole thing&mdash;skeptical, in
      fact, about it. And then to see them, one after another, stricken down,
      and looking a little sheepish and not saying much, and by-and-by radiant.
      You would think they owned the world. Heaven, I think, shows us no finer
      sarcasm than one of these young skeptics as a meek family man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Mr. Lyon were much together.
    </p>
    <p>
      And their talk, as always happens when two persons find themselves much
      together, became more and more personal. It is only in books that
      dialogues are abstract and impersonal. The Englishman told her about his
      family, about the set in which he moved&mdash;and he had the English
      frankness in setting it out unreservedly&mdash;about the life he led at
      Oxford, about his travels, and so on to what he meant to do in the world.
      Margaret in return had little to tell, her own life had been so simple&mdash;not
      much except the maidenly reserves, the discontents with herself, which
      interested him more than anything else; and of the future she would not
      speak at all. How can a woman, without being misunderstood? All this talk
      had a certain danger in it, for sympathy is unavoidable between two
      persons who look ever so little into each other&rsquo;s hearts and compare
      tastes and desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot quite understand your social life over here,&rdquo; Mr. Lyon was
      saying one day. &ldquo;You seem to make distinctions, but I cannot see exactly
      for what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they make themselves. Your social orders seem able to resist
      Darwin&rsquo;s theory, but in a republic natural selection has a better chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told by a Bohemian on the steamer coming over that money in America
      takes the place of rank in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t quite true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was told in Boston by an acquaintance of very old family and little
      fortune that &lsquo;blood&rsquo; is considered here as much as anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mr. Lyon, how difficult it is to get correct information about
      us. I think we worship wealth a good deal, and we worship family a good
      deal, but if any one presumes too much upon either, he is likely to come
      to grief. I don&rsquo;t understand it very well myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is not money that determines social position in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether; but more now than formerly. I suppose the distinction is
      this: family will take a person everywhere, money will take him almost
      everywhere; but money is always at this disadvantage&mdash;it takes more
      and more of it to gain position. And then you will find that it is a good
      deal a matter of locality. For instance, in Virginia and Kentucky family
      is still very powerful, stronger than any distinction in letters or
      politics or success in business; and there is a certain diminishing number
      of people in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, who cultivate a good deal of
      exclusiveness on account of descent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am told that this sort of aristocracy is succumbing to the new
      plutocracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is more and more difficult to maintain a position without money.
      Mr. Morgan says that it is a disheartening thing to be an aristocrat
      without luxury; he declares that he cannot tell whether the Knickerbockers
      of New York or the plutocrats are more uneasy just now. The one is hungry
      for social position, and is morose if he cannot buy it; and when the other
      is seduced by luxury and yields, he finds that his distinction is gone.
      For in his heart the newly rich only respects the rich. A story went about
      of one of the Bonanza princes who had built his palace in the city, and
      was sending out invitations to his first entertainment. Somebody suggested
      doubts to him about the response. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the beggars will be glad
      enough to come!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, Mr. Lyon,&rdquo; said Margaret, demurely, &ldquo;that this sort of thing
      is unknown in England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I couldn&rsquo;t say that money is not run after there to some extent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a picture in Punch of an auction, intended as an awful satire on
      American women. It struck me that it might have two interpretations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Punch is as friendly to America as it is to the English
      aristocracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was only thinking that it is just an exchange of commodities.
      People will always give what they have for what they want. The Western man
      changes his pork in New York for pictures. I suppose that&mdash;what do
      you call it?&mdash;the balance of trade is against us, and we have to send
      over cash and beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that Miss Debree was so much of a political economist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We got that out of books in school. Another thing we learned is that
      England wants raw material; I thought I might as well say it, for it
      wouldn&rsquo;t be polite for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m capable of saying anything, if provoked. But we have got away
      from the point. As far as I can see, all sorts of people intermarry, and I
      don&rsquo;t see how you can discriminate socially&mdash;where the lines are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon saw the moment that he had made it that this was a suggestion
      little likely to help him. And Margaret&rsquo;s reply showed that he had lost
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we do not try to discriminate&mdash;except as to foreigners. There is
      a popular notion that Americans had better marry at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the best way for a foreigner to break your exclusiveness is to be
      naturalized.&rdquo; Mr. Lyon tried to adopt her tone, and added, &ldquo;Would you like
      to see me an American citizen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you could be, except for a little while; you are too
      British.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the two nations are practically the same; that is, individuals of the
      nations are. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if one of them gives up all the habits and prejudices of a lifetime
      and of a whole social condition to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which would have to yield?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the man, of course. It has always been so. My great-great-grandfather
      was a Frenchman, but he became, I have always heard, the most docile
      American republican.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he would have been the one to give in if they had gone to
      France?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not. And then the marriage would have been unhappy. Did you never
      take notice that a woman&rsquo;s happiness, and consequently the happiness of
      marriage, depends upon a woman&rsquo;s having her own way in all social matters?
      Before our war all the men who married down South took the Southern view,
      and all the Southern women who married up North held their own, and
      sensibly controlled the sympathies of their husbands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how was it with the Northern women who married South, as you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it must be confessed that a good many of them adapted themselves,
      in appearance at least. Women can do that, and never let anyone see they
      are not happy and not doing it from choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you think American women adapt themselves happily to English
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless some; I doubt if many do; but women do not confess mistakes of
      that kind. Woman&rsquo;s happiness depends so much upon the continuation of the
      surroundings and sympathies in which she is bred. There are always
      exceptions. Do you know, Mr. Lyon, it seems to me that some people do not
      belong in the country where they were born. We have men who ought to have
      been born in England, and who only find themselves really they go there.
      There are who are ambitious, and court a career different from any that a
      republic can give them. They are not satisfied here. Whether they are
      happy there I do not know; so few trees, when at all grown, will bear
      transplanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think international marriages are a mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t theorize on subjects I am ignorant of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You give me very cold comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Margaret, with a laugh that was too genuine to be
      consoling, &ldquo;that you were traveling for comfort; I thought it was for
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am getting a great deal,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, rather ruefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      trying to find out where. I ought to have been born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; Margaret said, half seriously, &ldquo;but you would have been a
      very good American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not much of an admission, after all, but it was the most that
      Margaret had ever made, and Mr. Lyon tried to get some encouragement out
      of it. But he felt, as any man would feel, that this beating about the
      bush, this talk of nationality and all that, was nonsense; that if a woman
      loved a man she wouldn&rsquo;t care where he was born; that all the world would
      be as nothing to him; that all conditions and obstacles society and family
      could raise would melt away in the glow of a real passion. And he wondered
      for a moment if American girls were not &ldquo;calculating&rdquo;&mdash;a word to
      which he had learned over here to attach a new and comical meaning.

    <p>
      The afternoon after this conversation Miss Forsythe was sitting reading in
      her favorite window-seat when Mr. Lyon was announced. Margaret was at her
      school. There was nothing un usual in this afternoon call; Mr. Lyon&rsquo;s
      visits had become frequent and informal; but Miss Forsythe had a nervous
      presentiment that something important was to happen, that showed itself in
      her greeting, and which was perhaps caught from a certain new diffidence
      in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the maiden lady preserves more than any other this sensitiveness,
      inborn in women, to the approach of the critical moment in the affairs of
      the heart. The day may some time be past when she&mdash;is sensitive for
      herself&mdash;philosophers say otherwise&mdash;but she is easily put in a
      flutter by the affair of another. Perhaps this is because the negative (as
      we say in these days) which takes impressions retains all its delicacy
      from the fact that none of them have ever been developed, and perhaps it
      is a wise provision of nature that age in a heart unsatisfied should
      awaken lively apprehensive curiosity and sympathy about the manifestation
      of the tender passion in others. It certainly is a note of the kindliness
      and charity of the maiden mind that its sympathies are so apt to be most
      strongly excited in the success of the wooer. This interest may be quite
      separable from the common feminine desire to make a match whenever there
      is the least chance of it. Miss Forsythe was not a match-maker, but
      Margaret herself would not have been more embarrassed than she was at the
      beginning of this interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Lyon was seated she made the book she had in her hand the excuse
      for beginning a talk about the confidence young novelists seem to have in
      their ability to upset the Christian religion by a fictitious
      representation of life, but her visitor was too preoccupied to join in it.
      He rose and stood leaning his arm upon the mantel-piece, and looking into
      the fire, and said, abruptly, at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called to see you, Miss Forsythe, to&mdash;to consult you about your
      niece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About her career?&rdquo; asked Miss Forsythe, with a nervous consciousness of
      falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, about her career; that is, in a way,&rdquo; turning towards her with a
      little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have seen my interest in her. You must have known why I stayed
      on and on. But it was, it is, all so uncertain. I wanted to ask your
      permission to speak my mind to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you quite sure you know your own mind?&rdquo; asked Miss Forsythe,
      defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure&mdash;sure; I have never had the feeling for any other woman I have
      for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret is a noble girl; she is very independent,&rdquo; suggested Miss
      Forsythe, still avoiding the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I don&rsquo;t ask you her feeling.&rdquo; Mr. Lyon was standing quietly
      looking down into the coals. &ldquo;She is the only woman in the world to me. I
      love her. Are you against me?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly looking up, with a flush
      in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! no!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Forsythe, with another access of timidity. &ldquo;I
      shouldn&rsquo;t take the responsibility of being against you, or&mdash;or
      otherwise. It is very manly in you to come to me, and I am sure I&mdash;we
      all wish nothing but your own happiness. And so far as I am concerned&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I have your permission?&rdquo; he asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My permission, Mr. Lyon? why, it is so new to me, I scarcely realized
      that I had any permission,&rdquo; she said, with a little attempt at pleasantry.
      &ldquo;But as her aunt&mdash;and guardian, as one may say&mdash;personally I
      should have the greatest satisfaction to know that Margaret&rsquo;s destiny was
      in the hands of one we all esteem and know as we do you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, coming forward and seizing her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must let me say, let me suggest, that there are a great many
      things to be thought of. There is such a difference in education, in all
      the habits of your lives, in all your relations. Margaret would never be
      happy in a position where less was accorded to her than she had all her
      life. Nor would her pride let her take such a position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as my wife&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know that is sufficient in your mind. Have you consulted your
      mother, Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you written to any one at home about my niece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does it seem a little difficult to do so?&rdquo; This was a probe that went
      even deeper than the questioner knew. Mr. Lyon hesitated, seeing again as
      in a vision the astonishment of his family. He was conscious of an attempt
      at self-deception when he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not difficult, not at all difficult, but I thought I would wait till I
      had something definite to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret is, of course, perfectly free to act for herself. She has a very
      ardent nature, but at the same time a great deal of what we call common
      sense. Though her heart might be very much engaged, she would hesitate to
      put herself in any society which thought itself superior to her. You see I
      speak with great frankness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a new position for Mr. Lyon to find his prospective rank seemingly
      an obstacle to anything he desired. For a moment the whimsicality of it
      interrupted the current of his feeling. He thought of the probable
      comments of the men of his London club upon the drift his conversation was
      taking with a New England spinster about his fitness to marry a
      school-teacher. With a smile that was summoned to hide his annoyance, he
      said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I can defend myself, Miss Forsythe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she replied, with an answering smile that recognized his view of the
      humor of the situation, &ldquo;I was not thinking of you, Mr. Lyon, but of the
      family and the society that my niece might enter, to which rank is of the
      first importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am simply John Lyon, Miss Forsythe. I may never be anything else. But
      if it were otherwise, I did not suppose that Americans objected to rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was an unfortunate speech, felt to be so the instant it was uttered.
      Miss Forsythe&rsquo;s pride was touched, and the remark was not softened to her
      by the air of half banter with which the sentence concluded. She said,
      with a little stillness and formality: &ldquo;I fear, Mr. Lyon, that your
      sarcasm is too well merited. But there are Americans who make a
      distinction between rank and blood. Perhaps it is very undemocratic, but
      there is nowhere else more pride of family, of honorable descent, than
      here. We think very much of what we call good blood. And you will pardon
      me for saying that we are accustomed to speak of some persons and families
      abroad which have the highest rank as being thoroughly bad blood. If I am
      not mistaken, you also recognize the historic fact of ignoble blood in the
      owners of noble titles. I only mean, Mr. Lyon,&rdquo; she added, with a
      softening of manner, &ldquo;that all Americans do not think that rank covers a
      multitude of sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I get your American point of view. But to return to myself,
      if you will allow me; if I am so fortunate as to win Miss Debree&rsquo;s love, I
      have no fear that she would not win the hearts of all my family. Do you
      think that my&mdash;my prospective position would be an objection to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not your position, no; if her heart were engaged. But expatriation,
      involving a surrender of all the habits and traditions and associations of
      a lifetime and of one&rsquo;s kindred, is a serious affair. One would need to be
      very much in love&rdquo;&mdash;and Miss Forsythe blushed a little as she said it&mdash;&ldquo;to
      make such a surrender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I am sure I love her too much to wish to bring any change in her
      life that would ever cause her unhappiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to feel sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so I have your permission?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most sincerely,&rdquo; said Miss Forsythe, rising and giving him her hand. &ldquo;I
      could wish nothing better for Margaret than union with a man like you. But
      whatever I wish, you two have your destiny in your own hands.&rdquo; Her tone
      was wholly frank and cordial, but there was a wistful look in her face, as
      of one who knew how roughly life handles all youthful enthusiasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Lyon walked away from her door his feelings were very much
      mixed. At one instant his pride rebelled against the attitude he had just
      assumed. But this was only a flash, which he put away as unbecoming a man
      towards a true woman. The next thought was one of unselfish consideration
      for Margaret herself. He would not subject her to any chance of social
      mortifications. He would wait. He would return home and test his love by
      renewing his lifelong associations, and by the reception his family would
      give to his proposal. And the next moment he saw Margaret as she had
      become to him, as she must always be to him. Should he risk the loss of
      her by timidity? What were all these paltry considerations to his love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever a young man who could see any reasons against the
      possession of the woman he loved? Was there ever any love worth the name
      that could be controlled by calculations of expediency? I have no doubt
      that John Lyon went through the usual process which is called weighing a
      thing in the mind. It is generally an amusing process, and it is consoling
      to the conscience. The mind has little to do with it except to furnish the
      platform on which the scales are set up. A humorist says that he must have
      a great deal of mind, it takes him so long to make it up. There is the
      same apparent deliberation where love is concerned. Everything &ldquo;contra&rdquo; is
      carefully placed in one scale of the balance, and it is always
      satisfactory and convincing to see how quickly it kicks the beam when love
      is placed in the other scale. The lightest love in the world, under a law
      as invariable as gravitation, is heavier than any other known
      consideration. It is perhaps doing injustice to Mr. Lyon not to dwell upon
      this struggle in his mind, and to say that in all honesty he may not have
      known that the result of it was predetermined. But interesting and
      commendable as are these processes of the mind, I confess that I should
      have respected him less if the result had not been predetermined. And this
      does not in any way take from him the merit of a restless night and a
      tasteless breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philosophizers on this topic say that a man ought always to be able to
      tell by a woman&rsquo;s demeanor towards him whether she is favorably inclined,
      and that he need run no risk. Little signs, the eyes alone, draw people
      together, and make formal language superfluous. This theory is abundantly
      sustained by examples, and we might rest on it if all women knew their own
      minds, and if, on the other hand, they could always tell whether a man was
      serious before he made a definite avowal. There is another notion,
      fortunately not yet extinct, that the manliest thing a man can do is to
      take his life in his hand, pay the woman he loves the highest tribute in
      his power by offering her his heart and name, and giving her the definite
      word that may be the touchstone to reveal to herself her own feeling. In
      our conventional life women must move behind a mask in a world of
      uncertainties. What wonder that many of them learn in their defensive
      position to play a game, and sometimes experiment upon the honest natures
      of their admirers! But even this does not absolve the chivalrous man from
      the duty of frankness and explicitness. Life seems ideal in that far
      country where the handsome youth stops his carriage at the gate of the
      vineyard, and says to the laughing girl carrying a basket of grapes on her
      head, &ldquo;My pretty maid, will you marry me?&rdquo; And the pretty maid, dropping a
      courtesy, says, &ldquo;Thank you, sir; I am already bespoken,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thank you; I
      will consider of it when I know you better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not for a moment, I suppose, is a woman ever ignorant of a man&rsquo;s
      admiration of her, however uncertain she may be of his intentions, and it
      was with an unusual flutter of the heart that Margaret received Mr. Lyon
      that afternoon. If she had doubts, they were dissipated by a certain
      constraint in his manner, and the importance he seemed to be attaching to
      his departure, and she was warned to go within her defenses. Even the most
      complaisant women like at least the appearance of a siege.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off tomorrow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for Washington. You know you recommended it
      as necessary to my American education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We send Representatives and strangers there to be educated. I have
      never been there myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you not wish to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very much. All Americans want to go to Washington. It is the great social
      opportunity; everybody there is in society. You will be able to see there,
      Mr. Lyon, how a republican democracy manages social life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say there are no distinctions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; there are plenty of official distinctions, and a code that is
      very curious and complicated, I believe. But still society is open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be&mdash;pardon me&mdash;a good deal like a mob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, our mobs of that sort are said to be very well behaved. Mr. Morgan
      says that Washington is the only capital in the world where the principle
      of natural selection applies to society; that it is there shown for the
      first time that society is able to take care of itself in the free play of
      democratic opportunities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be very interesting to see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will find it so. The resident diplomats, I have heard, say
      that they find society there more agreeable than at any other capital&mdash;at
      least those who have the qualities to make themselves agreeable
      independent of their rank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing like a court? I cannot see who sets the mode.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officially there may be something like a court, but it can be only
      temporary, for the personnel of it is dissolved every four years. And
      society, always forming and reforming, as the voters of the republic
      dictate, is almost independent of the Government, and has nothing of the
      social caste of Berlin or London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make quite an ideal picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dare say it is not at all ideal; only it is rather fluid, and
      interesting, to see how society, without caste and subject to such
      constant change, can still be what is called &lsquo;society.&rsquo; And I am told that
      while it is all open in a certain way, it nevertheless selects itself into
      agreeable groups, much as society does elsewhere. Yes, you ought to see
      what a democracy can do in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am told that money makes your aristocracy here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely rich people think they are an aristocracy. You see, Mr. Lyon,
      I don&rsquo;t know much about the great world. Mrs. Fletcher, whose late husband
      was once a Representative in Washington, says that life is not nearly so
      simple there as it used to be, and that rich men in the Government, vying
      with rich men who have built fine houses and who live there permanently
      without any Government position, have introduced an element of expense and
      display that interferes very much with the natural selection of which Mr.
      Morgan speaks. But you will see. We are all right sorry to have you leave
      us,&rdquo; Margaret added, turning towards him with frank, unclouded eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good in you to say so. I have spent here the most delightful
      days of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is charming flattery. You will make us all very conceited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mock me, Miss Debree. I hoped I had awakened something more
      valuable to me than conceit,&rdquo; Lyon said, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, I assure you: gratitude. You have opened quite another world to
      us. Reading about foreign life does not give one at all the same
      impression of it that seeing one who is a part of it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you want to see that life for yourself? I hope some time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Margaret said, interrupting; &ldquo;all Americans expect to go to
      Europe. I have a friend who says she should be mortified if she reached
      heaven and there had to confess that she never had seen Europe. It is one
      of the things that is expected of a person. Though you know now that the
      embarrassing question that everybody has to answer is, &lsquo;Have you been to
      Alaska?&rsquo; Have you been to Alaska, Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This icy suggestion seemed very inopportune to Lyon. He rose and walked a
      step or two, and stood by the fire facing her. He confessed, looking down,
      that he had not been in Alaska, and he had no desire to go there. &ldquo;In
      fact, Miss Debree,&rdquo; he said, with effort at speaking lightly, &ldquo;I fear I am
      not in a geographical mood today. I came to say good-by, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I call my aunt?&rdquo; said Margaret, rising also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I beg; I had something to say that concerns us; that is, that
      concerns myself. I couldn&rsquo;t go away without knowing from you&mdash;that
      is, without telling you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The color rose in Margaret&rsquo;s cheek, and she made a movement of
      embarrassment, and said, with haste: &ldquo;Some other time; I beg you will not
      say&mdash;I trust that I have done nothing that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; he went on quickly; &ldquo;nothing except to be yourself; to
      be the one woman&rdquo;&mdash;he would not heed her hand raised in a gesture of
      protest; he stood nearer her now, his face flushed and his eyes eager with
      determination&mdash;&ldquo;the one woman I care for. Margaret, Miss Debree, I
      love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand that rested on the table trembled, and the hot blood rushed to
      her face, flooding her in an agony of shame, pleasure, embarrassment, and
      anger that her face should contradict the want of tenderness in her eyes.
      In an instant self-possession came back to her mind, but not strength to
      her body, and she sank into the chair, and looking up, with only pity in
      her eyes, said, &ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lyon stopped; his heart seemed to stand still; the blood left his face;
      for an instant the sunshine left the world. It was a terrible blow, the
      worst a man can receive&mdash;a bludgeon on the head is nothing to it. He
      half turned, he looked again for an instant at the form that was more to
      him than all the world besides, unable to face the dreadful loss, and
      recovering speech, falteringly said, &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all, Mr. Lyon,&rdquo; Margaret answered, not looking up, and in a voice
      that was perfectly steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to go mechanically, and passed to the door in a sort of daze,
      forgetful of all conventionality; but habit is strong, and he turned
      almost immediately back from the passage. Margaret was still sitting, with
      no recognition of his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you will make my excuses, and say good-by to Miss Forsythe. I had
      mentioned it to her. I thought perhaps she had told you, perhaps&mdash;I
      should like to know if it is anything about difference in&mdash;in
      nationality, about family, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Margaret; &ldquo;this could never be anything but a personal
      question with me. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said, &lsquo;some other time:&rsquo; Might I ever expect&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; there is no other time; do not go on. It can only be painful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with a forced cheerfulness: &ldquo;You will no doubt thank me some
      day. Your life must be so different from mine. And you must not doubt my
      esteem, my appreciation,&rdquo; (her sense of justice forced this from her), &ldquo;my
      good wishes. Good-by.&rdquo; She gave him her hand. He held it for a second, and
      then was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard his footstep, rapid and receding. So he had really gone! She was
      not sorry&mdash;no. If she could have loved him! She sank back in her
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she could not love him. The man to command her heart must be of
      another type. But the greatest experience in a woman&rsquo;s life had come to
      her here, just now, in this commonplace room. A man had said he loved her.
      A thousand times as a girl she had dreamed of that, hardly confessing it
      to herself, and thought of such a scene, and feared it. And a man had said
      that he loved her. Her eyes grew tenderer and her face burned at the
      thought. Was it with pleasure? Yes, and with womanly pain. What an awful
      thing it was! Why couldn&rsquo;t he have seen? A man had said he loved her.
      Perhaps it was not in her to love any one. Perhaps she should live on and
      on like her aunt Forsythe. Well, it was over; and Margaret roused herself
      as her aunt entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Lyon been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he has just gone. He was so sorry not to see you and say good-by. He
      left ever so many messages for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&rdquo; (Margaret was moving as if to go) &ldquo;did he say nothing&mdash;nothing
      to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, he said a great deal,&rdquo; answered this accomplished hypocrite,
      looking frankly in her aunt&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;He said how delightful his visit had
      been, and how sorry he was to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing else, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; he said he was going to Washington.&rdquo; And the girl was gone from
      the room.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret hastened to her chamber. Was the air oppressive? She opened the
      window and sat down by it. A soft south wind was blowing, eating away the
      remaining patches of snow; the sky was full of fleecy clouds. Where do
      these days come from in January? Why should nature be in a melting mood?
      Margaret instinctively would have preferred a wild storm, violence,
      anything but this elemental languor. Her emotion was incredible to
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only an incident. It had all happened in a moment, and it was over.
      But it was the first of the kind in a woman&rsquo;s life. The thrilling,
      mysterious word had been dropped into a woman&rsquo;s heart. Hereafter she would
      be changed. She never again would be as she was before. Would her heart be
      hardened or softened by the experience? She did not love him; that was
      clear. She had done right; that was clear. But he had said he loved her.
      Unwittingly she was following him in her thought. She had rejected plain
      John Lyon, amiable, intelligent, unselfish, kindly, deferential. She had
      rejected also the Earl of Chisholm, a conspicuous position, an honorable
      family, luxury, a great opportunity in life. It came to the girl in a
      flash. She moved nervously in her chair. She put down the thought as
      unworthy of her. But she had entertained it for a moment. In that second,
      ambition had entered the girl&rsquo;s soul. She had a glimpse of her own nature
      that seemed new to her. Was this, then, the meaning of her restlessness,
      of her charitable activities, of her unconfessed dreams of some career?
      Ambition had entered her soul in a definite form. She expelled it. It
      would come again in some form or other. She was indignant at herself as
      she thought of it. How odd it was! Her privacy had been invaded. The even
      tenor of her life had been broken. Henceforth would she be less or more
      sensitive to the suggestion of love, to the allurements of ambition?
      Margaret tried, in accordance with her nature, to be sincere with herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, what nonsense it was! Nothing really had happened. A stranger
      of a few weeks before had declared himself. She did not love him; he was
      no more to her than any other man. It was a common occurrence. Her
      judgment accorded with her feeling in what she had done. How was she to
      know that she had made a mistake, if mistake it was? How was she to know
      that this hour was a crisis in her life? Surely the little tumult would
      pass; surely the little whisper of worldliness could not disturb her
      ideals. But all the power of exclusion in her mind could not exclude the
      returning thought of what might have been if she had loved him. Alas! in
      that moment was born in her heart something that would make the idea of
      love less simple than it had been in her mind. She was heart-free, but her
      nature was too deep not to be profoundly affected by this experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back upon this afternoon in the light of after-years, she probably
      could not feel&mdash;no one could say&mdash;that she had done wrong. How
      was she to tell? Why is it that to do the right thing is often to make the
      mistake of a life? Nothing could have been nobler than for Margaret
      indignantly to put aside a temptation that her heart told her was
      unworthy. And yet if she had yielded to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to ask pardon, perhaps, for dwelling upon a thing so slight as the
      entrance of a thought in a woman&rsquo;s life. For as to Margaret, she seemed
      unchanged. She made no sign that anything unusual had occurred. We only
      knew that Mr. Lyon went away less cheerful than he usually was, that he
      said nothing of returning in response to our invitations, and that he
      seemed to anticipate nothing but the fulfillment of a duty in his visit to
      Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened was regarded as only an episode. In fact, however, I
      doubt if there are any episodes in our lives, any asides, that do not
      permanently affect our entire career. Are not the episodes, the casual
      thoughts, the fortuitous, unplanned meetings, the brief and maybe at the
      moment unnoted events, those which exercise the most influence on our
      destiny? To all observation the career of Lyon, and not of Margaret, was
      most affected by their interview. But often the implanting of an idea in
      the mind is more potent than the frustration of a plan or the
      gratification of a desire, so hidden are the causes that make character.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time I saw little of Margaret. Affairs in which I was not alone
      or chiefly concerned took me from home. One of the most curious and
      interesting places in the world is a Chamber in the business heart of New
      York&mdash;if that scene of struggle and passion can be said to have a
      heart&mdash;situated midway where the currents of eagerness to acquire the
      money of other people, not to make it, ceaselessly meet and dash against
      each other. If we could suppose there was a web covering this region, spun
      by the most alert and busy of men to catch those less alert and more
      productive, here in this Chamber would sit the ingenious spiders. But the
      analogy fails, for spiders do not prey upon each other. Scientists say
      that the human system has two nerve-centres&mdash;one in the brain, to
      which and from which are telegraphed all movements depending upon the
      will, and another in the small of the back, the centre of the involuntary
      operations of respiration, digestion, and so on. It may be fanciful to
      suppose that in the national system Washington is the one nervous centre
      and New York the other. And yet it does sometimes seem that the nerves and
      ganglions in the small of the back in the commercial metropolis act
      automatically and without any visible intervention of intelligence. For
      all that, their operations may be as essential as the other, in which the
      will-power sometimes gets into a deadlock, and sometimes telegraphs the
      most eccentric and incomprehensible orders. Puzzled by these
      contradictions, some philosophers have said that there may be somewhere
      outside of these two material centres another power that keeps affairs
      moving along with some steadiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This noble Chamber has a large irregular area of floor space, is very
      high, and has running round three sides a narrow elevated gallery, from
      which spectators can look down upon the throng below. Upon a raised dais
      at one side sits the presiding genius of the place, who rules very much as
      Jupiter was supposed to govern the earthly swarms, by letting things run
      and occasionally launching a thunderbolt. High up on one side, in an
      Olympian seclusion, away from the noise and the strife, sits a Board, calm
      as fate, and panoplied in the responsibility of chance, whose function
      seems to be that of switch-shifters in their windowed cubby at a network
      of railway intersections&mdash;to prevent collisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At both ends of the floor and along one side are narrow railed-off spaces
      full of clerks figuring at desks, of telegraph operators clicking their
      machines, of messenger-boys arriving and departing in haste, of
      unprivileged operators nervously watching the scene and waiting the chance
      of a word with some one on the floor; through noiseless swinging doors men
      are entering and departing every moment&mdash;men in a hurry, men with
      anxious faces, conscious that the fate of the country is in their hands.
      On the floor itself are five hundred, perhaps a thousand, men, gathered
      for the most part in small groups about little stands upon the summit of
      which is a rallying legend, talking, laughing, screaming, good-natured,
      indifferent, excited, running hither and thither in response to changing
      figures in the checker-board squares on the great wall opposite&mdash;calm,
      cynical one moment, the next violently agitated, shouting, gesticulating,
      rushing together, shaking their fists in a tumult of passion which
      presently subsides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swarms ebb and flow about these little stands&mdash;bees, not bringing
      any honey, but attracted to the hive where it is rumored most honey is to
      be had. By habit some always stand or sit about a particular hive, waiting
      for the show of comb. By-and-by there is a stir; the crowd thickens; one
      beardless youth shouts out the figure &ldquo;one-half&rdquo;; another howls,
      &ldquo;three-eighths.&rdquo; The first one nods. It is done. The electric wire running
      up the stand quivers and takes the figure, passes it to all the other
      wires, transmits it to every office and hotel in the city, to all the
      &ldquo;tickers&rdquo; in ten thousand chambers and &ldquo;bucketshops&rdquo; and offices in the
      republic. Suddenly on the bulletin-boards in New Orleans, Chicago, San
      Francisco, Podunk, Liverpool, appear the mysterious &ldquo;three-eighths,&rdquo;
       electrifying the watchers of these boards, who begin to jabber and
      gesticulate and &ldquo;transact business.&rdquo; It is wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      What induced the beardless young man to make this &ldquo;investment&rdquo; in
      &ldquo;three-eighths&rdquo;&mdash;who can tell? Perhaps he had heard, as he came into
      the room, that the Secretary of the Treasury was going to make a call of
      Fives; perhaps he had heard that Bismarck had said that the French blood
      was too thin and needed a little more iron; perhaps he had heard that a
      norther in Texas had killed a herd of cattle, or that two grasshoppers had
      been seen in the neighborhood of Fargo, or that Jay Hawker had been
      observed that morning hurrying to his brokers with a scowl on his face and
      his hat pulled over his eyes. The young man sold what he did not have, and
      the other young man bought what he will never get.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is business of the higher and almost immaterial sort, and has an
      element of faith in it, and, as one may say, belief in the unseen, whence
      it is characterized by an expression&mdash;&ldquo;dealing in futures.&rdquo; It is not
      gambling, for there are no &ldquo;chips&rdquo; used, and there is no roulette-table in
      sight, and there are no piles of money or piles of anything else. It is
      not a lottery, for there is no wheel at which impartial men preside to
      insure honest drawings, and there are no predestined blanks and prizes,
      and the man who buys and the man who sells can do something, either in the
      newspapers or elsewhere, to affect the worth of the investment, whereas in
      a lottery everything depends upon the turn of the blind wheel. It is not
      necessary, however, to attempt a defense of the Chamber. It is one of the
      recognized ways of becoming important and powerful in this world. The
      privilege of the floor&mdash;a seat, as it is called&mdash;in this temple
      of the god Chance to be Rich is worth more than a seat in the Cabinet. It
      is not only true that a fortune may be made here in a day or lost here in
      a day, but that a nod and a wink here enable people all over the land to
      ruin others or ruin themselves with celerity. The relation of the Chamber
      to the business of the country is therefore evident. If an earthquake
      should suddenly sink this temple and all its votaries into the bowels of
      the earth, with all its nervousness and all its electricity, it is
      appalling to think what would become of the business of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from this vast Chamber, where great financial operations are
      conducted on the highest principles of honor, and with the strictest
      regard to the Marquis of Dusenbury&rsquo;s rules, there is another less
      pretentious Chamber, known as &ldquo;open,&rdquo; a sort of overflow meeting. Those
      who have not quite left hope behind can go in here. Here are the tickers
      communicating with the Chamber, tended by lads, who transfer the figures
      to big blackboards on the wall. In front of these boards sit, from morning
      to night, rows, perhaps relays, of men intently or listlessly watching the
      figures. Many of them, who seldom make a sign, come here from habit; they
      have nowhere else to go. Some of them were once lords in the great
      Chamber, who have been, as the phrase is, &ldquo;cleaned out.&rdquo; There is a
      gray-bearded veteran in seedy clothes, with sunken fiery eyes, who was
      once many times a millionaire, was a power in the Board, followed by
      reporters, had a palace in the Avenue, and drove to his office with
      coachman and footman in livery, and his wife headed the list of charities.
      Now he spends his old age watching this blackboard, and considers it a
      good day that brings him five dollars and his car-fare. At one end of the
      low-ceiled apartment are busy clerks behind a counter, alert and cheerful.
      If one should go through a side door and down a passage he might encounter
      the smell of rum. Smart young men, clad in the choicest raiment from the
      misfit counters, with greed stamped on their astute faces, bustle about,
      watch the blackboards, and make investments with each other. Middle-aged
      men in slouch hats lounge around with hungry eyes. The place is feverish
      rather than exciting. A tall fellow, whose gait and clothes proclaim him
      English, with a hard face and lack-lustre eyes, saunters about; his
      friends at home suppose he is making his fortune in America. A dapper
      young gentleman, quite in the mode, and with the quick air of prosperity,
      rapidly enters the room and confers with a clerk at the counter. He has
      the run of the Chamber, and is from the great house of Flamm and Slamm.
      Perhaps he is taking a &ldquo;flier&rdquo; on his own account, perhaps he represents
      his house in a side transaction; there are so many ways open to
      enterprising young men in the city; at any rate, his entrance is regarded
      as significant: This is not a hospital for the broken down and &ldquo;cleaned
      out&rdquo; of the Chamber, but it is a place of business, which is created and
      fed by the incessant &ldquo;ticker.&rdquo; How men existed or did any business at all
      before the advent of the &ldquo;ticker&rdquo; is a wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Chamber, the creator of low-pressure and high-pressure, the
      inspirer of the &ldquo;ticker,&rdquo; is the great generator of business. Here I found
      Henderson in the morning hour, and he came up to me on the call of a
      messenger. He approached, nonchalant and smiling as usual. &ldquo;Do you see
      that man,&rdquo; he said, as we stood a moment looking down, &ldquo;sitting there on a
      side bench&mdash;big body, small head, hair grayish, long beard parted&mdash;apparently
      taking no interest in anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Flink, who made the corner in O. B.&mdash;one of the
      longest-headed operators in the Chamber. He is about the only man who dare
      try a hold with Jay Hawker. And for some reason or another, though they
      have apparent tussles, Hawker rather favors him. Five years ago he could
      just raise money enough to get into the Chamber. Now he is reckoned at
      anywhere from five to ten millions. I was at his home the other night.
      Everybody was there. I had a queer feeling, in all the magnificence, that
      the sheriff might be in there in ten days. Yet he may own a good slice of
      the island in ten years. His wife, whom I complimented, and who thanked me
      for coming, said she had invited none but the reshershy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks like a rascal,&rdquo; I ventured to remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is not a word used in the Chamber. He is called a &lsquo;daisy.&rsquo; I was
      put into his pew in church the other Sunday, and the preacher described
      him and his methods so exactly that I didn&rsquo;t dare look at him. When we
      came out he whispered, &lsquo;That was rather hard on Slack; he must have felt
      it.&rsquo; These men rather like that sort of preaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t come here often,&rdquo; Henderson resumed, as we walked away. &ldquo;The
      market is flat today. There promised to be a little flurry in L. and P.,
      and I looked in for a customer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We walked to his down-town club to lunch. Everybody, I noticed, seemed to
      know Henderson, and his presence was hailed with a cordial smile, a
      good-humored nod, or a hearty grasp of the hand. I never knew a more
      prepossessing man; his bonhomie was infectious. Though his demeanor was
      perfectly quiet and modest, he carried the air of good-fellowship. He was
      entirely frank, cordial, and had that sort of sincerity which one can
      afford to have who does not take life too seriously. Tall&mdash;at least
      six feet-with a well-shaped head set on square shoulders, brown hair
      inclined to curl, large blue eyes which could be merry or exceedingly
      grave, I thought him a picture of manly beauty. Good-natured, clever,
      prosperous, and not yet thirty. What a dower!
    </p>
    <p>
      After we had disposed of our little matter of business, which I confess
      was not exactly satisfactory to me, although when I was told that &ldquo;the
      first bondholders will be obliged to come in,&rdquo; he added that &ldquo;of course we
      shall take care of our friends,&rdquo; we went to his bachelor quarters uptown.
      &ldquo;I want you to see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how a hermit lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The apartments were not my idea of a hermitage&mdash;except in the city. A
      charming library, spacious, but so full as to be cozy, with an open fire;
      chamber, dressing-room, and bathroom connecting, furnished with everything
      that a luxurious habit could suggest and good taste would not refuse, made
      a retreat that could almost reconcile a sinner to solitude. There were a
      few good paintings, many rare engravings, on the walls, a notable absence,
      even in the sleeping-room, of photographs of actresses and professional
      beauties, but here and there souvenirs of travel and evidences that the
      gentler sex had contributed the skill of their slender fingers to the
      cheerfulness of the bachelor&rsquo;s home. Scattered about were the daily and
      monthly products of the press, the newest sensations, the things talked
      about at dinners, but the walls for the most part were lined with books
      that are recognized as the proper possessions of the lover of books, and
      most of them in exquisite bindings. Less care, I thought, had been given
      in the collection to &ldquo;sets&rdquo; of &ldquo;standards&rdquo; than to those that are rare, or
      for some reason, either from distinguished ownership or autograph notes,
      have a peculiar value.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this atmosphere, when we were prepared to take our ease, the talk was
      no longer of stocks, or railways, or schemes, but of books. Whether or not
      Henderson loved literature I did not then make up my mind, but he had a
      passion for books, especially for rare and first editions; and the delight
      with which he exhibited his library, the manner in which he handled the
      books that he took down one after the other, the sparkle in his eyes over
      a &ldquo;find&rdquo; or a bargain, gave me a side of his character quite different
      from that I should have gained by seeing him &ldquo;in the street&rdquo; only. He had
      that genuine respect and affection for a &ldquo;book&rdquo; which has become almost
      traditional in these days of cheap and flimsy publications, a taste held
      by scholars and collectors, and quite beyond the popular comprehension.
      The respect for a book is essential to the dignity and consideration of
      the place of literature in the world, and when books are treated with no
      more regard than the newspaper, it is a sign that literature is losing its
      power. Even the collector, who may read little and care more for the
      externals than for the soul of his favorites, by the honor he pays them,
      by the solicitude he expends upon their preservation without spot, by the
      lavishness of expense upon binding, contributes much to the dignity of
      that art which preserves for the race the continuity of its thought and
      development. If Henderson loved books merely as a collector whose taste
      for luxury and expense takes this direction, his indulgence could not but
      have a certain refining influence. I could not see that he cultivated any
      decided specialty, but he had many rare copies which had cost fabulous
      prices, the possession of which gives a reputation to any owner. &ldquo;My
      shelves of Americana,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are nothing like Goodloe&rsquo;s, who has a lot
      of scarce things that I am hoping to get hold of some day. But there&rsquo;s a
      little thing&rdquo; (it was a small coffee-colored tract of six leaves, upon
      which the binder of the city had exercised his utmost skill) &ldquo;which
      Goodloe offered me five hundred dollars for the other day. I picked it up
      in a New Hampshire garret.&rdquo; Not the least interesting part of the
      collection was first editions of American authors&mdash;a person&rsquo;s value
      to a collector is often in proportion to his obscurity&mdash;and what most
      delighted him among them were certain thin volumes of poetry, which the
      authors since becoming famous had gone to a good deal of time and expense
      to suppress. The world seems to experience a lively pleasure in holding a
      man to his early follies. There were many examples of superb binding,
      especially of exquisite tooling on hog-skin covers&mdash;the appreciation
      of which has lately greatly revived. The recent rage for bindings has been
      a sore trouble to students and collectors in special lines, raising the
      prices of books far beyond their intrinsic value. I had a charming
      afternoon in Henderson&rsquo;s library, an enjoyment not much lessened at the
      time by experiencing in it, with him, rather a sense of luxury than of
      learning. It is true, one might pass an hour altogether different in the
      garret of a student, and come away with quite other impressions of the
      pageant of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock his stylish trap was sent around from the boarding stable,
      and we drove in the Park till twilight. Henderson handling the reins, and
      making a part of that daily display which is too heterogeneous to have
      distinction, reverted quite naturally to the tone of worldliness and
      tolerant cynicism which had characterized his conversation in the morning.
      If the Park and the moving assemblage had not the air of distinction, it
      had that of expense, which is quite as attractive to many. Here, as
      downtown, my companion seemed to know and be known by everybody, returning
      the familiar salutes of brokers and club men, receiving gracious bows from
      stout matrons, smiles and nods from pretty women, and more formal
      recognition from stately and stiff elderly men, who sat bolt-upright
      beside their wives and tried to look like millionaires. For every passerby
      Henderson had a quick word of characterization sufficiently amusing, and
      about many a story which illuminated the social life of the day. It was
      wonderful how many of this chance company had little &ldquo;histories&rdquo;&mdash;comic,
      tragic, pitiful, interesting enough for the pages of a novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a young lady&rdquo;&mdash;Henderson touched his hat, and I caught a
      glimpse of golden hair and a flash of dark eyes out of a mass of furs&mdash;&ldquo;who
      has no history: the world is all before her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The daughter of old Eschelle&mdash;Carmen Eschelle&mdash;the banker and
      politician, you remember; had a diplomatic position abroad, and the girl
      was educated in Europe. She is very clever. She and her mother have more
      money than they ought to know what to do with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the celebrated Jay Hawker&rdquo; ( a moment after), &ldquo;in the modest
      coupe&mdash;not much display about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he recognized by respectable people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Recognized?&rdquo; Henderson laughed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a power. There are plenty of people
      who live by trying to guess what he is going to do. Hawker isn&rsquo;t such a
      bad fellow. Other people have used the means he used to get rich and
      haven&rsquo;t succeeded. They are not held up to point a moral. The trouble is
      that Hawker succeeded. Of course, it&rsquo;s a game. He plays as fair as
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Henderson resumed, walking his horses in sight of the obelisk,
      which suggested the long continuance of the human race, &ldquo;it is the same
      old game, and it is very interesting to those who are in it. Outsiders
      think it is all greed. In the Chamber it is a good deal the love of the
      game, to watch each other, to find out a man&rsquo;s plans, to circumvent him,
      to thwart him, to start a scheme and manipulate it, to catch somebody, to
      escape somebody; it is a perpetual excitement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The machine in the Chamber appears to run very smoothly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Oh,
      that is a public register and indicator. The system back of it is
      comprehensive, and appears to be complicated, but it is really very
      simple. Spend an hour some day in the office of Flamm and Slamm, and you
      will see a part of the system. There are, always a number of men watching
      the blackboard, figures on which are changed every minute by the
      attendants. Telegrams are constantly arriving from every part of the
      Union, from all over the continent, from all the centres in Europe, which
      are read by some one connected with the firm, and then displayed for the
      guidance of the watchers of the blackboard. Upon this news one or another
      says, &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll buy,&rsquo; or &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll sell,&rsquo; so and so. His order is
      transmitted instantly to the Chamber. In two minutes the result comes back
      and appears upon the blackboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where does the news come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the men whose special business it is to pick it up or make it. They
      are inside of politics, of the railways, of the weather bureau,
      everywhere. The other day in Chicago I sat some time in a broker&rsquo;s office
      with others watching the market, and dropped into conversation with a
      bright young fellow, at whose right hand, across the rail, was a telegraph
      operator at the end of a private wire. Soon a man came in quietly, and
      whispered in the ear of my neighbor and went out. The young fellow
      instantly wrote a despatch and handed it to the operator, and turning to
      me, said, &lsquo;Now watch the blackboard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an incredibly short space of time a fall in a leading railway showed
      on the blackboard. &lsquo;What was it?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Why, that man was the general
      freight manager of the A. B. road. He told me that they were to cut rates.
      I sent it to New York by a private wire.&rsquo; I learned by further
      conversation that my young gentleman was a Manufacturer of News, and that
      such was his address and intelligence that though he was not a member of
      the broker&rsquo;s firm, he made ten thousand a year in the business. Soon
      another man came in, whispered his news, and went away. Another despatch&mdash;another
      responsive change in the figures. &lsquo;That,&rsquo; explained my companion, &lsquo;was a
      man connected with the weather bureau. He told me that there would be a
      heavy frost tonight in the Northwest.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they sell the weather?&rdquo; I asked, very much amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, twice; once over a private wire, and then to the public, after the
      value of it has been squeezed out, in the shape of predictions. Oh, the
      weather bureau is worth all the money it costs, for business purposes. It
      is a great auxiliary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dining that evening with Henderson at his club, I had further opportunity
      to study a representative man. He was of a good New Hampshire family,
      exceedingly respectable without being distinguished. Over the
      chimney-place in the old farmhouse hung a rusty Queen Anne that had been
      at the taking of Louisburg. His grandfather shouldered a musket at Bunker
      Hill; his father, the youngest son, had been a judge as well as a farmer,
      and noted for his shrewdness and reticence. Rodney, inheriting the thrift
      of his ancestors, had pushed out from his home, adapting this thrift to
      the modern methods of turning it to account. He had brought also to the
      city the stamina of three generations of plain living&mdash;a splendid
      capital, by which the city is constantly reinforced, and which one
      generation does not exhaust, except by the aid of extreme dissipation.
      With sound health, good ability, and fair education, he had the cheerful
      temperament which makes friends, and does not allow their misfortunes to
      injure his career. Generous by impulse, he would rather do a favor than
      not, and yet he would be likely to let nothing interfere with any object
      he had in view for himself. Inheriting a conventional respect for religion
      and morality, he was not so bigoted as to rebuke the gayety of a convivial
      company, nor so intractable as to make him an uncomfortable associate in
      any scheme, according to the modern notions of business, that promised
      profit. His engaging manner made him popular, and his good-natured
      adroitness made him successful. If his early experience of life caused him
      to be cynical, he was not bitterly so; his cynicism was of the tolerant
      sort that does not condemn the world and withdraw from it, but courts it
      and makes the most of it, lowering his private opinion of men in
      proportion as he is successful in the game he plays with them. At this
      period I could see that he had determined to be successful, and that he
      had not determined to be unscrupulous. He would only drift with the tide
      that made for fortune. He enjoyed the world&mdash;a sufficient reason why
      the world should like him. His business morality was gauged by what other
      people do in similar circumstances. In short, he was a product of the
      period since the civil war closed, that great upheaval of patriotic
      feeling and sacrifice, which ended in so much expansion and so many
      opportunities. If he had remained in New Hampshire he would probably have
      been a successful politician, successful not only in keeping in place, but
      in teaching younger aspirants that serving the country is a very good way
      to the attainment of luxury and the consideration that money brings. But
      having chosen the law as a stepping-stone to the lobby, to speculation,
      and the manipulation of chances, he had a poor opinion of politics and of
      politicians. His success thus far, though considerable, had not been
      sufficient to create for him powerful enemies, so that he may be said to
      be admired by all and feared by none. In the general opinion he was a
      downright good fellow and amazingly clever.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In youth, as at the opera, everything seems possible. Surely it is not
      necessary to choose between love and riches. One may have both, and the
      one all the more easily for having attained the other. It must be a
      fiction of the moralists who construct the dramas that the god of love and
      the god of money each claims an undivided allegiance. It was in some
      wholly legendary, perhaps spiritual, world that it was necessary to
      renounce love to gain the Rhine gold. The boxes at the Metropolitan did
      not believe this. The spectators of the boxes could believe it still less.
      For was not beauty there seen shining in jewels that have a market value,
      and did not love visibly preside over the union, and make it known that
      his sweetest favors go with a prosperous world? And yet, is the charm of
      life somewhat depending upon a sense of its fleetingness, of its
      phantasmagorial character, a note of coming disaster, maybe, in the midst
      of its most seductive pageantry, in the whirl and glitter and hurry of it?
      Is there some subtle sense of exquisite satisfaction in snatching the
      sweet moments of life out of the very delirium of it, that must soon end
      in an awakening to bankruptcy of the affections, and the dreadful loss of
      illusions? Else why do we take pleasure&mdash;a pleasure so deep that it
      touches the heart like melancholy&mdash;in the common drama of the opera?
      How gay and joyous is the beginning! Mirth, hilarity, entrancing sound,
      brilliant color, the note of a trumpet calling to heroism, the beseeching
      of the concordant strings, and the soft flute inviting to pleasure; scenes
      placid, pastoral, innocent; light-hearted love, the dance on the green,
      the stately pageant in the sunlit streets, the court, the ball, the mad
      splendor of life. And then love becomes passion, and passion thwarted
      hurries on to sin, and sin lifts to the heights of the immortal, sweetly
      smiling gods, and plunges to the depths of despair. In vain the orchestra,
      the inevitable accompaniment of life, warns and pleads and admonishes;
      calm has gone, and gayety has gone; there is no sweetness now but in the
      wildness of surrender and of sacrifice. How sad are the remembered strains
      that aforetime were incentives to love and promises of happiness! Gloom
      settles upon the scene; Mephisto, the only radiant one, flits across it,
      and mocks the poor broken-hearted girl clinging to the church door. There
      is a dungeon, the chanting of the procession of tonsured priests, the
      passing-bell. Seldom appears the golden bridge over which the baffled and
      tired pass into Valhalla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do we like this because it is life, or because there is a certain
      satisfaction in seeing the tragedy which impends over all, pervades the
      atmosphere, as it were, and adds something of zest to the mildest
      enjoyment? Should we go away from the mimic stage any, better and stronger
      if the drama began in the dungeon and ended on the greensward, with
      innocent love and resplendent beauty in possession of the Rhine gold?
    </p>
    <p>
      How simple, after all, was the created world on the stage to the real
      world in the auditorium, with its thousand complexities and dramatic
      situations, and if the little knot of players of parts for an hour could
      have had leisure to be spectators of the audience, what a deeper
      revelation of life would they not have seen! For the world has never
      assembled such an epitome of itself, in its passion for pleasure and its
      passion for display, as in the modern opera, with its ranks and tiers of
      votaries from the pit to the dome. I fancy that even Margaret, whose love
      for music was genuine, was almost as much fascinated by the greater
      spectacle as by the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a crowded night, for the opera was one that appealed to the senses
      and stimulated them to activity, and left the mind free to pursue its own
      schemes; in a word, orchestra and the scenes formed a sort of
      accompaniment and interpreter to the private dramas in the boxes. The
      opera was made for society, and not society for the opera. We occupied a
      box in the second tier&mdash;the Morgans, Margaret, and my wife. Morgan
      said that the glasses were raised to us from the parquet and leveled at us
      from the loges because we were a country party, but he well enough knew
      whose fresh beauty and enthusiastic young face it was that drew the fire
      when the curtain fell on the first act, and there was for a moment a
      little lull in the hum of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had heard,&rdquo; Morgan was saying, &ldquo;that the opera was not acclimated in
      New York; but it is nearly so. The audience do not jabber so loud nor so
      incessantly as at San Carlo, and they do not hum the airs with the singers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that is because they do not know the airs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are getting on in cultivation, and learning how to assert the
      social side of the opera, which is not to be seriously interfered with by
      the music on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the music, the scenery, were never before so good,&rdquo; I replied to
      these cynical observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true. And the social side has risen with it. Do you know what an
      impudent thing the managers did the other night in protesting against the
      raising of the lights by which the house was made brilliant and the cheap
      illusions of the stage were destroyed? They wanted to make the house
      positively gloomy for the sake of a little artificial moonlight on the
      painted towers and the canvas lakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the world goes, the scene was brilliant, of course with republican
      simplicity. The imagination was helped by no titled names any more than
      the eye was by the insignia of rank, but there was a certain glow of
      feeling, as the glass swept the circle, to know that there were ten
      millions in this box, and twenty in the next, and fifty in the next,
      attested well enough by the flash of jewels and the splendor of attire,
      and one might indulge a genuine pride in the prosperity of the republic.
      As for beauty, the world, surely, in this later time, had flowered here&mdash;flowered
      with something of Aspasia&rsquo;s grace and something of the haughty coldness of
      Agrippina. And yet it was American. Here and there in the boxes was a
      thoroughbred portrait by Copley&mdash;the long shapely neck, the sloping
      shoulders, the drooping eyelids, even to the gown in which the
      great-grandmother danced with the French officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that lovely creature?&rdquo; asked Margaret, indicating a box opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not know. There were two ladies, and behind them I had no difficulty
      in making out Henderson and&mdash;Margaret evidently had not seen him Mr.
      Lyon. Almost at the same moment Henderson recognized me, and signaled for
      me to come to his box. As I rose to do so, Mrs. Morgan exclaimed: &ldquo;Why,
      there is Mr. Lyon! Do tell him we are here.&rdquo; I saw Margaret&rsquo;s color rise,
      but she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was presented to Mrs. Eschelle and her daughter; in the latter I
      recognized the beauty who had flashed by us in the Park. The elder lady
      inclined to stoutness, and her too youthful apparel could not mislead one
      as to the length of her pilgrimage in this world, nor soften the hard
      lines of her worldly face-lines acquired, one could see, by a social
      struggle, and not drawn there by an innate patrician insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are glad to see a friend of Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and of Mr.
      Lyon&rsquo;s also. Mr. Lyon has told us much of your charming country home. Who
      is that pretty girl in your box, Mr. Fairchild?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Eschelle had her glass pointed at Margaret as I gave the desired
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How innocent!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s quite in the style&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      she, Mr. Lyon?&rdquo; she asked, turning about, her sweet mobile face quite the
      picture of what she was describing. &ldquo;We are all innocent in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very good style,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it becoming?&rdquo; asked the girl, making her dark eyes at once merry
      and demure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon was looking intently at the opposite box, and a slight shade came
      over his fine face. &ldquo;Ah, I see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Eschelle,&rdquo; he said, after a second, &ldquo;I hardly
      know which to admire most, the beauty, or the wit, or the innocence of the
      American women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing so confusing, though, as the country innocence,&rdquo; the
      girl said, with the most natural air; &ldquo;it never knows where to stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too absurd, Carmen,&rdquo; her mother interposed; &ldquo;as if the town girl
      did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mamma, there is authority for saying that there is a time for
      everything, only one must be in the fashion, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon looked a little dubious at this turn of the talk; Mr. Henderson
      was as evidently amused at the girl&rsquo;s acting. I said I was glad to see
      that goodness was in fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it often is. You know we were promised a knowledge of good as well as
      evil. It depends upon the point of view. I fancy, now, that Mr. Henderson
      tolerates the good&mdash;that is the reason we get on so well together;
      and Mr. Lyon tolerates the evil&mdash;that&rsquo;s the reason he likes New York.
      I have almost promised him that I will have a mission school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked quite capable of it, or of any other form of devotion.
      Notwithstanding her persistent banter, she had a most inviting innocence
      of manner, almost an ingenuousness, that well became her exquisite beauty.
      And but for a tentative daring in her talk, as if the gentle creature were
      experimenting as to how far one could safely go, her innocence might have
      seemed that of ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came out in the talk that Mr. Lyon had been in Washington for a week,
      and would return there later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had a claim on him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Eschelle, &ldquo;for his kindness to us in
      London, and we are trying to convince him that New York is the real
      capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; added Miss Eschelle, looking up in Mr. Lyon&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;he
      visited Brandon first, and you seem to have bewitched him with your simple
      country ways. I can get him to talk of nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say,&rdquo; Mr. Lyon replied, with the air of retorting, &ldquo;that you
      have asked me about nothing else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know we felt a little responsible for you; and there is no place
      so dangerous as the country. Now here you are protected&mdash;we put all
      the wickedness on the stage, and learn to recognize and shun it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be wicked,&rdquo; said her mother, &ldquo;but it is dull. Don&rsquo;t you find it
      so, Mr. Henderson? I am passionately fond of Wagner, but it is too noisy
      for anything tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice, dear,&rdquo; the dutiful daughter replied for all of us, &ldquo;that you
      have to raise your voice. But there is the ballet. Let us all listen now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon excused himself from going with me, saying that he would call at
      our hotel, and I took Henderson. &ldquo;I shall count the minutes you are going
      to lose,&rdquo; the girl said as we went out-to our box. The lobbies in the
      interact were thronged with men&mdash;for the most part the young
      speculators of the Chamber turned into loungers in the foyer&mdash;knowing,
      alert, attitudinizing in the extreme of the mode, unable even in this hour
      to give beauty the preference to business, well knowing, perhaps, that
      beauty itself in these days has a fine eye for business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked Henderson better in our box than in his own. Was it because the
      atmosphere was more natural and genuine? Or was it Margaret&rsquo;s transparent
      nature, her sincere enjoyment of the scene, her evident pleasure in the
      music, the color, the gayety of the house, that made him drop the slight
      cynical air of the world which had fitted him so admirably a moment
      before? He already knew my wife and the Morgans, and, after the greetings
      were made, he took a seat by Margaret, quite content while the act was
      going on to watch its progress in the play of her responsive features. How
      quickly she felt, how the frown followed the smile, how, she seemed to
      weigh and try to apprehend the meaning of what went on&mdash;how her every
      sense enjoyed life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is absurd,&rdquo; she said, turning her bright face to him when the curtain
      dropped, &ldquo;to be so interested in fictitious trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure that it is,&rdquo; he replied, in her own tone; &ldquo;the opera is a
      sort of pulpit, and not seldom preaches an awful sermon&mdash;more plainly
      than the preacher dares to make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not in nomine Dei.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But who can say what is most effective? I often wonder, as I watch
      the congregations coming from the churches on the Avenue, if they are any
      more solemnized than the audiences that pour out of this house. I confess
      that I cannot shake off &lsquo;Lohengrin&rsquo; in a good while after I hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you think the theatres have a moral influence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly&rdquo;&mdash;and I heard his good-natured laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
      swear to that. But then we don&rsquo;t know what New York might be without
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Margaret, reflectively, &ldquo;that my own good impulses,
      such as I have, are excited by anything I see on the stage; perhaps I am
      more tolerant, and maybe toleration is not good. I wonder if I should grow
      worldly, seeing more of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is not the stage so much as the house,&rdquo; Henderson replied,
      beginning to read the girl&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it would be different if one came alone and saw the play,
      unconscious of the house, as if it were a picture. I think it is the house
      that disturbs one, makes one restless and discontented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never analyzed my emotions,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;but when I was a boy and
      came to the theatre I well remember that it made me ambitious; every sort
      of thing seemed possible of attainment in the excitement of the crowded
      house, the music, the lights, the easy successes on the stage; nothing
      else is more stimulating to a lad; nothing else makes the world more
      attractive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And does it continue to have the same effect, Mr. Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; and he smiled; &ldquo;the illusion goes, and the stage is about as
      real as the house&mdash;usually less interesting. It can hardly compete
      with the comedy in the boxes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is lack of experience, but I like the play for itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; desire for the dramatic is natural. People will have it somehow.
      In the country village where there are no theatres the people make dramas
      out of each other&rsquo;s lives; the most trivial incidents are magnified and
      talked about&mdash;dramatized, in short.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean gossiped about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may call it gossip&mdash;nothing can be concealed; everybody
      knows about everybody else; there is no privacy; everything is used to
      create that illusory spectacle which the stage tries to give. I think that
      in the country village a good theatre would be a wholesome influence,
      satisfy a natural appetite indicated by the inquisition into the affairs
      of neighbors, and by the petty scandal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are on the way to it,&rdquo; said Mr. Morgan, who sat behind them; &ldquo;we have
      theatricals in the church parlors, which may grow into a nineteenth
      century substitute for the miracle-plays. You mustn&rsquo;t, Margaret, let Mr.
      Henderson prejudice you against the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the latter, quickly; &ldquo;I was only trying to defend the city. We
      country people always do that. We must base our theatrical life on
      something in nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the difference, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; asked Margaret, &ldquo;between the
      gossip in the boxes and the country gossip you spoke of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In toleration mainly, and lack of exact knowledge. It is here rather
      cynical persiflage, not concentrated public opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; said Morgan. &ldquo;It seems to me that in the city you&rsquo;ve
      got gossip plus the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, we have the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to believe that,&rdquo; said Margaret, seriously&mdash;&ldquo;your
      definition of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make me see that it was a poor jest,&rdquo; he said, rising to go.
      &ldquo;By-the-way, we have a friend of yours in our box tonight&mdash;a young
      Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Lyon. We were all delighted with him. Such a transparent, genuine
      nature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that we should be happy to see him at our
      hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Henderson came back to his box Carmen did not look up, but she said,
      indifferently: &ldquo;What, so soon? But your absence has made one person
      thoroughly miserable. Mr. Lyon has not taken his eyes off you. I never saw
      such an international attachment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more could I do for Miss Eschelle than to leave her in such
      company?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Lyon. &ldquo;Miss Eschelle must believe that I
      thoroughly appreciate Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s self-sacrifice. If I occasionally
      looked over where he was, I assure you it was in pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are both altogether too self-sacrificing,&rdquo; the beauty replied,
      turning to Henderson a look that was sweetly forgiving. &ldquo;They who sin much
      shall be forgiven much, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That leaves me,&rdquo; Mr. Lyon answered, with a laugh, &ldquo;as you say over here,
      out in the cold, for I have passed a too happy evening to feel like a
      transgressor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sins of omission are the worst sort,&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what you must do to be forgiven,&rdquo; Henderson said to Lyon, with
      that good-natured smile that was so potent to smooth away sharpness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I can never do enough to qualify myself.&rdquo; And he also laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never will,&rdquo; Carmen answered, but she accompanied the doubt with a
      witching smile that denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this about forgiveness?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Eschelle, turning to them
      from regarding the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we were having an experience meeting behind your back, mamma, only
      Mr. Henderson won&rsquo;t tell his experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Eschelle is in such a forgiving humor tonight that she absolves
      before any one has a chance to confess,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I am always so, Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lyon bowed. &ldquo;I think that an opera-box with Miss Eschelle is the
      easiest confessional in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something like a compliment. You see&rdquo; (to Henderson) &ldquo;how much you
      Americans have to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be my teacher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or your pupil,&rdquo; the girl said, in a low voice, standing near him as she
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was over. In the robing and descending through the corridors
      there were the usual chatter, meaning looks, confidential asides. It is
      always at the last moment, in the hurry, as in a postscript, that woman
      says what she means, or what for the moment she wishes to be thought to
      mean. In the crowd on the main stairway the two parties saw each other at
      a distance, but without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that Lyon is &lsquo;epris&rsquo; there?&rdquo; Carmen whispered to Henderson
      when she had scanned and thoroughly inventoried Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know as much as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you did stay a long time,&rdquo; she said, in a lower tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Margaret&rsquo;s party waited for their carriage she saw Mrs. Eschelle and
      her daughter enter a shining coach, with footman and coachman in livery.
      Henderson stood raising his hat. A little white hand was shaken to him
      from the window, and a sweet, innocent face leaned forward&mdash;a face
      with dark, eyes and golden hair, lit up with a radiant smile. That face
      for the moment was New York to Margaret, and New York seemed a vain show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen threw herself back in her seat as if weary. Mrs. Eschelle sat
      bolt-upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world, child, made you go on so tonight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you snub Mr. Lyon so often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? He won&rsquo;t mind much. Didn&rsquo;t you see, mother, that he was distrait
      the moment he espied that girl? I&rsquo;m not going to waste my time. I know the
      signs. No fisheries imbroglio for me, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish? Who said anything about fish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the international business. Ask Mr. Henderson to explain it. The
      English want to fish in our waters, I believe. I think Mr. Lyon has had a
      nibble from a fresh-water fish. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the other way, and he&rsquo;s
      hooked. There be fishers of men, you know, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a strange child, Carmen. I hope you will be civil to both of
      them.&rdquo; And they rode on in silence.

      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      In real life the opera or the theatre is only the prologue to the evening.
      Our little party supped at Delgardo&rsquo;s. The play then begins. New York is
      quite awake by that time, and ready to amuse itself. After the public
      duty, the public attitudinizing, after assisting at the artificial comedy
      and tragedy which imitate life under a mask, and suggest without
      satisfying, comes the actual experience. My gentle girl&mdash;God bless
      your sweet face and pure heart!&mdash;who looked down from the sky-parlor
      at the Metropolitan upon the legendary splendor of the stage, and the
      alluring beauty and wealth of the boxes, and went home to create in dreams
      the dearest romance in a maiden&rsquo;s life, you did not know that for many the
      romance of the night just began when the curtain fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets were as light as day. At no other hour were the pavements so
      thronged, was there such a crush of carriages, such a blockade of cars,
      such running, and shouting, greetings and decorous laughter, such a swirl
      of pleasurable excitement. Never were the fashionable cafes and
      restaurants so crowded and brilliant. It is not a carnival time; it is
      just the flow and ebb of a night&rsquo;s pleasure, an electric night which has
      all of the morning except its peace, a night of the gayest opportunity and
      unlimited possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      At each little table was a drama in progress, light or serious&mdash;all
      the more serious for being light at the moment and unconsidered. Morgan,
      who was so well informed in the gossip of society and so little involved
      in it&mdash;some men have this faculty, which makes them much more
      entertaining than the daily newspaper&mdash;knew the histories of half the
      people in the room. There were an Italian marquis and his wife supping
      together like lovers, so strong is the force of habit that makes this
      public life necessary even when the domestic life is established. There is
      a man who shot himself rather seriously on the doorsteps of the beauty who
      rejected him, and in a year married the handsome and more wealthy woman
      who sits opposite him in that convivial party. There is a Russian
      princess, a fair woman with cool observant eyes, making herself agreeable
      to a mixed company in three languages. In this brilliant light is it not
      wonderful how dazzlingly beautiful the women are&mdash;brunettes in yellow
      and diamonds, blondes in elaborately simple toilets, with only a bunch of
      roses for ornament, in the flush of the midnight hour, in a radiant glow
      that even the excitement and the lifted glass cannot heighten? That pretty
      girl yonder&mdash;is she wife or widow?&mdash;slight and fresh and fair,
      they say has an ambition to extend her notoriety by going upon the stage;
      the young lady with her, who does not seem to fear a public place, may be
      helping her on the road. The two young gentlemen, their attendants, have
      the air of taking life more seriously than the girls, but regard with
      respectful interest the mounting vivacity of their companions, which rises
      and sparkles like the bubbles in the slender glasses which they raise to
      their lips with the dainty grace of practice. The staid family parties who
      are supping at adjoining tables notice this group with curiosity, and
      express their opinion by elevated eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret leaned back in her chair and regarded the whole in a musing&rsquo; 
      frame of mind. I think she apprehended nothing of it except the light, the
      color, the beauty, the movement of gayety. For her the notes of the
      orchestra sounded through it all&mdash;the voices of the singers, the hum
      of the house; it was all a spectacle and a play. Why should she not enjoy
      it? There was something in the nature of the girl that responded to this
      form of pleasure&mdash;the legitimate pleasure the senses take in being
      gratified. &ldquo;It is so different,&rdquo; she said to me, &ldquo;from the pleasure one
      has in an evening by the fire. Do you know, even Mr. Morgan seems worldly
      here.&rdquo;

    <p>
      It was a deeper matter than she thought, this about worldliness, which had
      been raised in Margaret&rsquo;s mind. Have we all double natures, and do we
      simply conform to whatever surrounds us? Is there any difference in kind
      between the country worldliness and the city worldliness? I do not suppose
      that Margaret formulated any of these ideas in words. Her knowledge of the
      city had hitherto been superficial. It was a place for shopping, for a day
      in a picture exhibition, for an evening in the theatre, no more a part of
      her existence than a novel or a book of travels: of the life of the town
      she knew nothing. That night in her room she became aware for the first
      time of another world, restless, fascinating, striving, full of
      opportunities. What must London be?
    </p>
    <p>
      If we could only note the first coming into the mind of a thought that
      changes life and re-forms character&mdash;supposing that every act and
      every new departure has this subtle beginning&mdash;we might be less the
      sport of circumstances than we seem to be. Unnoted, the desire so swiftly
      follows the thought and juggles with the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Mr. Henderson left his card and a basket of roses. Mr. Lyon
      called. It was a constrained visit. Margaret was cordially civil, and I
      fancied that Mr. Lyon would have been more content if she had been less
      so. If he were a lover, there was little to please him in the exchange of
      the commonplaces of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he was saying to my wife, &ldquo;perhaps I shall have to change my mind
      about the simplicity of your American life. It is much the same in New
      York and London. It is only a question of more or less sophistication.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Henderson tells us,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;that you knew the Eschelles in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Miss Eschelle almost had a career there last season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why almost?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you will pardon me&mdash;one needs for success in these days
      to be not only very clever, but equally daring. It is every day more
      difficult to make a sensation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought her, across the house,&rdquo; Margaret said, &ldquo;very pretty and
      attractive. I did not know you were so satirical, Mr. Lyon. Do you mean
      that one must be more daring, as you call it, in London than in New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it will not hurt your national pride, Miss Debree, if I say that
      there is always the greater competition in the larger market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my pride,&rdquo; Margaret answered, &ldquo;does not lie in that direction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to do her justice, I don&rsquo;t think Miss Eschelle&rsquo;s does, either. She
      appears to be more interested now in New York than in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed as he said this, and Margaret laughed also, and then stopped
      suddenly, thinking of the roses that came that morning. Could she be
      comparing the Londoner with the handsome American who sat by her side at
      the opera last night? She was half annoyed with herself at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are not you also interested in New York, Mr. Lyon?&rdquo; my wife asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, moderately so, if you will permit me to say it.&rdquo; It was an effort on
      his part to keep up the conversation, Margaret was so wholly unresponsive;
      and afterwards, knowing how affairs stood with them, I could understand
      his well-bred misery. The hardest thing in the world is to suffer
      decorously and make no sign in the midst of a society which insists on
      stoicism, no matter how badly one is hurt. The Society for First Aid to
      the Injured hardens its heart in these cases. &ldquo;I have never seen another
      place,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;where the women are so busy in improving
      themselves. Societies, clubs, parlor lectures, readings, recitations,
      musicales, classes&mdash;it fatigues one to keep in sight of them. Every
      afternoon, every evening, something. I doubt if men are capable of such
      incessant energy, Mrs. Fairchild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you find they have no time to be agreeable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite the contrary. There is nothing they are not interesting in, nothing
      about which they cannot talk, and talk intensely. They absorb everything,
      and have the gift of acquiring intelligence without, as one of them told
      me, having to waste time in reading. Yes, it is a most interesting city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coming in of Mr. Morgan gave another turn to the talk. He had been to
      see a rural American play, an exhibition of country life and character,
      constructed in absolute disregard of any traditions of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; Mr. Morgan said, &ldquo;a foreigner would understand it; it
      would be impossible in Paris, incomprehensible in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw it,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, thus appealed to. &ldquo;It was very odd, and
      seemed to amuse the audience immensely. I suppose one must be familiar
      with American farm life to see the points of it. I confess that while I
      sat there, in an audience so keenly in sympathy with the play&mdash;almost
      a part of it, one might say&mdash;I doubted if I understood your people as
      well as I thought I did when I had been here a week only. Perhaps this is
      the beginning of an American drama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people say that it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is so local!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything that is true must be true to local conditions, to begin with.
      The only question is, is it true to human nature? What puzzled me in this
      American play was its raising the old question of nature and art. You&rsquo;ve
      seen Coquelin? Well, that is acting, as artificial as a sonnet, the
      perfection of training, skill in an art. You never doubt that he is
      performing in a play for the entertainment of an audience. You have the
      same enjoyment of it that you have of a picture&mdash;a picture, I mean,
      full of character and sentiment, not a photograph. But I don&rsquo;t think of
      Denman Thompson as an actor trained to perfection in a dramatic school,
      but as a New Hampshire farmer. I don&rsquo;t admire his skill; I admire him.
      There is plenty that is artificial, vulgarly conventional, in his play,
      plenty of imitation of the rustic that shows it is imitation, but he is
      the natural man. If he is a stage illusion, he does not seem so to me.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Probably to an American audience only he does not,&rdquo; Mr. Lyon remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is getting to be a tolerably large audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if you will change the laws of art,&rdquo; said Mr. Lyon, rising to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall hope to see you again at our house,&rdquo; my wife said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very good. I should like it; but my time is running out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you cannot come, you may leave your adieus with Miss Debree, who is
      staying some time in the city,&rdquo; my wife said, evidently to Margaret&rsquo;s
      annoyance. But she could do no less than give him her city address, though
      the information was not accompanied by any invitation in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was to stay some time with two maiden ladies, old friends of her
      mother, the Misses Arbuser. The Arbusers were people of consequence in
      their day, with a certain social prestige; in fact, the excellent ladies
      were two generations removed from successful mercantile life, which in the
      remote prospective took on an old-family solidity. Nowhere else in the
      city could Margaret have come closer in contact with a certain phase of
      New York life in which women are the chief actors&mdash;a phase which may
      be a transition, and may be only a craze. It is not so much a
      condescension of society to literature as it is a discovery that
      literature and art, in the persons of those who produce both, may be
      sources of amusement, or perhaps, to be just, of the enlargement of the
      horizon and the improvement of the mind. The society mind was never before
      so hospitable to new ideas and new sensations. Charities, boards of
      managers, missions, hospitals, news-rooms, and lodging-houses for the
      illiterate and the homeless&mdash;these are not sufficient, even with
      balls, dancing classes, and teas, for the superfluous energies of this
      restless, improving generation; there must be also radical clubs, reading
      classes, study classes, ethical, historical, scientific, literary
      lectures, the reading of papers by ladies of distinction and gentlemen of
      special attainments&mdash;an unremitting pursuit of culture and
      information. Curiosity is awake. The extreme of social refinement and a
      mild Bohemianism almost touch. It passes beyond the affectation of knowing
      persons who write books and write for the press, artists in paint and
      artists in music. &ldquo;You cannot be sure in the most exclusive circle&rdquo;&mdash;it
      was Carmen Eschelle who said this&mdash;&ldquo;that you will not meet an author
      or even a journalist.&rdquo; Not all the women, however, adore letters or affect
      enthusiasm at drawing-room lectures; there are some bright and cynical
      ones who do not, who write papers themselves, and have an air of being
      behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had thought that she was fully occupied in the country, with her
      teaching, her reading, her literature and historical clubs, but she had
      never known before what it was to be busy and not have time for anything,
      always in pursuit of some new thing, and getting a fragment here and
      there; life was a good deal like reading the dictionary and remembering
      none of the words. And it was all so cosmopolitan and all-embracingly
      sympathetic. One day it was a paper by a Servian countess on the social
      life of the Servians, absorbingly interesting both in itself and because
      it was a countess who read it; and this was followed by the singing of an
      Icelandic tenor and a Swedish soprano, and a recital on the violin by a
      slight, red-haired, middle-aged woman from London. All the talents seem to
      be afloat and at the service of the strenuous ones who are cultivating
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first function at which Margaret assisted in the long drawing-rooms of
      the Arbusers was a serious one&mdash;one that combined the charm of
      culture with the temptations of benevolence. The rooms were crowded with
      the fashion of the town, with a sprinkling of clergymen and of thin
      philanthropic gentlemen in advanced years. It was a four-o&rsquo;clock, and the
      assembly had the cheerfulness of a reception, only that the display of
      toilets was felt to be sanctified by a purpose. The performance opened
      with a tremendous prelude on the piano by Herr Bloomgarten, who had been
      Liszt&rsquo;s favorite pupil; indeed, it was whispered that Liszt had said that,
      old as he was, he never heard Bloomgarten without learning something.
      There was a good deal of subdued conversation while the pianist was in his
      extreme agony of execution, and a hush of extreme admiration&mdash;it was
      divine, divine, ravishing&mdash;when he had finished. The speaker was a
      learned female pundit from India, and her object was to interest the women
      of America in the condition of their unfortunate Hindoo sisters. It
      appeared that thousands and tens of thousands of them were doomed to early
      and lifelong widowhood, owing to the operation of cruel caste laws, which
      condemned even girls betrothed to deceased Brahmins to perpetual celibacy.
      This fate could only be alleviated by the education and elevation of
      women. And money was needed for schools, especially for medical schools,
      which would break down the walls of prejudice and enfranchise the sex. The
      appeal was so charmingly made that every one was moved by it, especially
      the maiden ladies present, who might be supposed to enter into the
      feelings of their dusky sisters beyond the seas. The speaker said, with a
      touch of humor that always intensifies a serious discourse, that she had
      been told that in one of the New England States there was a superfluity of
      unmarried women; but this was an entirely different affair; it was a
      matter of choice with these highly educated and accomplished women. And
      the day had come when woman could make her choice! At this there was a
      great clapping of hands. It was one thing to be free to lead a life of
      single self-culture, and quite another to be compelled to lead a single
      fife without self-culture. The address was a great success, and much
      enthusiasm spread abroad for the cause of the unmarried women of India.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the audience were Mrs. Eschelle and her daughter. Margaret and Carmen
      were made acquainted, and were drawn together by curiosity, and perhaps by
      a secret feeling of repulsion. Carmen was all candor and sweetness, and
      absorbingly interested in the women of India, she said. With Margaret&rsquo;s
      permission she would come and see her, for she believed they had common
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would seem that there could not be much sympathy between natures so
      opposed, persons who looked at life from such different points of view,
      but undeniably Carmen had a certain attraction for Margaret. The New
      Englander, whose climate is at once his enemy and his tonic, always longs
      for the tropics, which to him are a region of romance, as Italy is to the
      German. In his nature, also, there is something easily awakened to the
      allurements of a sensuous existence, and to a desire for a freer
      experience of life than custom has allowed him. Carmen, who showed to
      Margaret only her best side&mdash;she would have been wise to exhibit no
      other to Henderson, but women of her nature are apt to cheapen themselves
      with men&mdash;seemed an embodiment of that graceful gayety and
      fascinating worldliness which make the world agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, a few days after the Indian function, Margaret was alone in
      her own cozy sitting-room. Nothing was wanting that luxury could suggest
      to make it in harmony with a beautiful woman, nothing that did not flatter
      and please, or nurse, perhaps, a personal sense of beauty, and impart that
      glow of satisfaction which comes when the senses are adroitly ministered
      to. Margaret had been in a mood that morning to pay extreme attention to
      her toilet. The result was the perfection of simplicity, of freshness, of
      maiden purity, enhanced by the touch of art. As she surveyed herself in
      the pier-glass, and noted the refined lines of the morning-gown which
      draped but did not conceal the more exquisite lines of her figure, and
      adjusted a rose in her bosom, she did not feel like a Puritan, and,
      although she may not have noted the fact, she did not look like one. It
      was not a look of vanity that she threw into the mirror, or of special
      self-consciousness; in her toilet she had obeyed only her instinct (that
      infallible guide in a woman of refinement), and if she was conscious of
      any emotion, it was of the stirring within her of the deepest womanly
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, she was restless. She flung herself into an easy-chair before the
      fire, and took up a novel. It was a novel with a religious problem. In
      vain she tried to be interested in it. At home she would have absorbed it
      eagerly; they would have discussed it; the doubts and suggestions in it
      would have assumed the deepest personal importance. It might have made an
      era in her thoughtful country life. Here it did not so appeal to her; it
      seemed unreal and shadowy in a life that had so much more of action than
      of reflection in it. It was a life fascinating and exciting, and
      profoundly unsatisfactory. Yet, after all, it was more really life than
      that placid vegetation in the country. She felt that in the whirl of only
      a few days of it&mdash;operas, receptions, teas, readings, dances,
      dinners, where everybody sparkled with a bewildering brilliancy, and yet
      from which one brought away nothing but a sense of strain; such gallantry,
      such compliments, such an easy tossing about of every topic under heaven;
      such an air of knowing everything, and not caring about anything very
      much; so much mutual admiration and personal satisfaction! She liked it,
      and perhaps was restless because she liked it. To be admired, to be
      deferred to&mdash;was there any harm in that? Only, if one suffers
      admiration today, it becomes a necessity tomorrow. She began to feel the
      influence of that life which will not let one stand still for a moment. If
      it is not the opera, it is a charity; if it is not a lover, it is some
      endowed cot in a hospital. There must be something going on every day,
      every hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she was restless, and could not read. She thought of Mr. Henderson.
      He had called formally. She had seen him, here and there, again and again.
      He had sought her out in all companies; his face had broken into a smile
      when he met her; he had talked with her lightly, gayly; she remembered the
      sound of his voice; she had learned to know his figure in a room among a
      hundred; and she blushed as she remembered that she had once or twice
      followed him with her eyes in a throng. He was, to be sure, nothing to
      her; but he was friendly; he was certainly entertaining; he was a part,
      somehow, of this easy-flowing life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Eschelle was announced. Margaret begged that she would come upstairs
      without ceremony. The mutual taking-in of the pretty street costume and
      the pretty morning toilet was the work of a moment&mdash;the photographer
      has invented no machine that equals a woman&rsquo;s eyes for such a purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful it is! how altogether charming!&rdquo; and Margaret felt that
      she was included with the room in this admiration. &ldquo;I told mamma that I
      was coming to see you this morning, even if I missed the Nestors&rsquo; 
      luncheon. I like to please myself sometimes. Mamma says I&rsquo;m frivolous, but
      do you know&rdquo;&mdash;the girls were comfortably seated by the fire, and
      Carmen turned her sweet face and candid eyes to her companion&mdash;&ldquo;I get
      dreadfully tired of all this going round and round. No, I don&rsquo;t even go to
      the Indigent Mothers&rsquo; Home; it&rsquo;s part of the same thing, but I haven&rsquo;t any
      gift that way. Ah, you were reading&mdash;that novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I was trying to read it; I intend to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have had it! It&rsquo;s a little past now, but it has been all the rage.
      Everybody has read it; that is, I don&rsquo;t know that anybody has read it, but
      everybody has been talking about it. Of course somebody must have read it,
      to set the thing agoing. And it has been discussed to death. I sometimes
      feel as if I had changed my religion half a dozen times in a fortnight.
      But I haven&rsquo;t heard anything about it for a week. We have taken up the
      Hindoo widows now, you know.&rdquo; And the girl laughed, as if she knew she
      were talking nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do not read much in the city?&rdquo; Margaret asked, with an answering
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in the summer. That is, some do. There is a reading set. I don&rsquo;t
      know that they read much, but there is a reading set. You know, Miss
      Debree, that when a book is published&mdash;really published, as Mr.
      Henderson says&mdash;you don&rsquo;t need to read it. Somehow it gets into the
      air and becomes common property. Everybody hears the whole thing. You can
      talk about it from a notice. Of course there are some novels that one must
      read in order to understand human nature. Do you read French?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but not many French novels; I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor can I,&rdquo; said Carmen, with a sincere face. &ldquo;They are too realistic for
      me.&rdquo; She was at the moment running over in her mind a &ldquo;situation&rdquo; in a
      paper-covered novel turned down on her nightstand. &ldquo;Mr. Henderson says
      that everybody condemns the French novels, and that people praise the
      novels they don&rsquo;t read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Mr. Henderson very well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we&rsquo;ve known him a long time. He is the only man I&rsquo;m afraid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know he is a sort of Club man; that style of man provokes your
      curiosity, for you never can tell how much such men know. It makes you a
      little uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen was looking into the fire, as if abstractedly reflecting upon the
      nature of men in general, but she did not fail to notice a slight
      expression of pain on Margaret&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is your Mr. Lyon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret laughed. &ldquo;You do me too much honor. I think you discovered him
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, our Mr. Lyon.&rdquo; Carmen was still looking into the fire. &ldquo;He is such
      a good young man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not exactly fancy this sort of commendation, and she replied,
      with somewhat the tone of defending him, &ldquo;We all have the highest regard
      for Mr. Lyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he is quite gone on Brandon, I assure you. He intends to do a
      great deal of good in the world. I think he spends half his time in New
      York studying, he calls it, our charitable institutions. Mamma reproaches
      me that I don&rsquo;t take more interest in philanthropy. That is her worldly
      side. Everybody has a worldly side. I&rsquo;m as worldly as I can be&rdquo;&mdash;this
      with a look of innocence that denied the self-accusation&mdash;&ldquo;but I
      haven&rsquo;t any call to marry into Exeter Hall and that sort of thing. That is
      what she means&mdash;dear mamma. Are you High-Church or evangelical?&rdquo; she
      asked, after a moment, turning to Margaret?
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret explained that she was neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am High-Church, and Mr. Lyon is evangelical-Church evangelical.
      There couldn&rsquo;t be any happiness, you know, without harmony in religious
      belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said Margaret, now quite recovering herself. &ldquo;It
      must be a matter of great anxiety to you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen was quick to note the change of tone, and her face beamed with
      merriment as she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense I&rsquo;ve been talking! I did not intend to go into such deep
      things. You must not mind what I said about Mr.&mdash;(a little pause to
      read Margaret&rsquo;s face)&mdash;Mr. Lyon. We esteem him as much as you do. How
      charming you are looking this morning! I wish I had your secret of not
      letting this life tell on one.&rdquo; And she was gone in a shower of
      compliments and smiles and caressing ways. She had found out what she came
      to find out. Mr. Henderson needs watching, she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview, as Margaret thought it over, was amusing, but it did not
      raise her spirits. Was everybody worldly and shallow? Was this the sort of
      woman whom Mr. Henderson fancied? Was Mr. Henderson the sort of man to
      whom such a woman would be attracted?

      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a dinner party in one of the up-town houses&mdash;palaces&mdash;that
      begin to repeat in size, spaciousness of apartments, and decoration the
      splendor of the Medicean merchant princes. It is the penalty that we pay
      for the freedom of republican opportunity that some must be very rich.
      This is the logical outcome of the open chance for everybody to be rich&mdash;and
      it is the surest way to distinction. In a free country the course must be
      run, and it is by the accumulation of great wealth that one can get beyond
      anxiety, and be at liberty to indulge in republican simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret and Miss Arbuser were ushered in through a double row of servants
      in livery&mdash;shortclothes and stockings&mdash;in decorous vacuity&mdash;an
      array necessary to bring into relief the naturalness and simplicity of the
      entertainers. Vulgarity, one can see, consists in making one&rsquo;s self a part
      of the display of wealth: the thing to be attained is personal simplicity
      on a background of the richest ostentation. It is difficult to attain
      this, and theory says that it takes three generations for a man to
      separate himself thus from his display. It was the tattle of the town that
      the first owner of the pictures in the gallery of the Stott mansion used
      to tell the prices to his visitors; the third owner is quite beyond
      remembering them. He might mention, laughingly, that the ornamented shovel
      in the great fireplace in the library was decorated by Vavani&mdash;it was
      his wife&rsquo;s fancy. But he did not say that the ceiling in the music-room
      was painted by Pontifex Lodge, or that six Italian artists had worked four
      years making the Corean room, every inch of it exquisite as an intaglio&mdash;indeed,
      the reporters had made the town familiar with the costly facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present occupants understood quite well the value of a background: the
      house swarmed with servants&mdash;retainers, one might say. Margaret, who
      was fresh from her history class, recalled the days of Elizabeth, when a
      man&rsquo;s importance was gauged by the retinue of servitors and men and women
      in waiting. And this is, after all, a better test of wealth than a mere
      accumulation of things and cost of decoration; for though men and women do
      not cost so much originally as good pictures&mdash;that is, good men and
      women&mdash;everybody knows that it needs more revenue to maintain them.
      Though the dinner party was not large, there was to be a dance afterwards,
      and for every guest was provided a special attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was served in the state dining-room, to which Mr. Henderson had
      the honor of conducting Margaret. Here prevailed also the same studied
      simplicity. The seats were for sixteen. The table went to the extremity of
      elegant plainness, no crowding, no confusion of colors under the soft
      lights; if there was ostentation anywhere, it was in the dazzling fineness
      of the expanse of table-linen, not in the few rare flowers, or the
      crystal, or the plate, which was of solid gold, simply modest. The eye is
      pleased by this chastity&mdash;pure whiteness, the glow of yellow, the
      slight touch of sensuous warmth in the rose. The dinner was in keeping,
      short, noiselessly served under the eye of the maitre d&rsquo;hotel, few
      courses, few wines; no anxiety on the part of the host and hostess&mdash;perhaps
      just a little consciousness that everything was simple and elegant, a
      little consciousness of the background; but another generation will remove
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If to Margaret&rsquo;s country apprehension the conversation was not quite up to
      the level of the dinner and the house&mdash;what except that of a circle
      of wits, who would be out of place there, could be?&mdash;the presence of
      Mr. Henderson, who devoted himself to her, made the lack unnoticed. The
      talk ran, as usual, on the opera, Wagner, a Christmas party at Lenox, at
      Tuxedo, somebody&rsquo;s engagement, some lucky hit in the Exchange, the
      irritating personalities of the newspapers, the last English season, the
      marriage of the Duchess of Bolinbroke, a confidential disclosure of who
      would be in the Cabinet and who would have missions, a jocular remark
      across the table about a &ldquo;corner&rdquo; (it is impossible absolutely here, as
      well as at a literary dinner, to sink the shop), the Sunday opening of
      galleries&mdash;anything to pass the hour, the ladies contributing most of
      the vivacity and persiflage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you, Mr. Henderson&rdquo;&mdash;it was Mrs. Laflamme raising her voice&mdash;&ldquo;the
      other night in a box with a very pretty woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Miss Eschelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know them. We used to hear of them in Naples, Venice, various
      places; they were in Europe some time; I believe. She was said to be very
      entertaining&mdash;and enterprising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose they have seen something of the world. The other lady was
      her mother. And the man with us&mdash;that might interest you more, Mrs.
      Laflamme, was Mr. Lyon, who will be the Earl of Chisholm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Then I suppose she has money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw any painful evidence of poverty. But I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Lyon
      is fortune-hunting. He seems to be after information and&mdash;goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret flushed a little, but apparently Henderson did not notice it.
      Then she said (after Mrs. Laflamme had dropped the subject with the remark
      that he had come to the right place), &ldquo;Miss Eschelle called on me
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was, no doubt, agreeable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was, as Mrs. Laflamme says, entertaining. She quoted you a good
      deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quoted me? For what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As one would a book, as a familiar authority.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to be flattered, if you will excuse the street
      expression, to have my stock quotable. Perhaps you couldn&rsquo;t tell whether
      Miss Eschelle was a bull or a bear in this case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t clearly know what that is. She didn&rsquo;t offer me any,&rdquo; said
      Margaret, in a tone of carrying on the figure without any personal
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she is a bit of an operator. A good many women here amuse
      themselves a little in stocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me very feminine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? But women generally like to&rsquo; take risks and chances. In countries
      where lotteries are established they always buy tickets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! then they only risk what they have. I think women are more prudent
      and conservative than men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. They are conservatives usually. But when they do go in for
      radical measures and risks, they leave us quite behind.&rdquo; Mr. Henderson did
      not care to extend the conversation in this direction, and he asked,
      abruptly, &ldquo;Are you finding New York agreeable, Miss Debree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Yes and no. One has no time to one&rsquo;s self. Do you understand why it
      is, Mr. Henderson, that one can enjoy the whole day and then be thoroughly
      dissatisfied with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly; when the excitement is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I don&rsquo;t seem to be myself here. I have a feeling of having lost
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the world is so big?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that. Do you know, the world seems much smaller here than at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the city appears narrow and provincial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot quite explain it. The interests of life don&rsquo;t seem so large&mdash;the
      questions, I mean, what is going on in Europe, the literature, the
      reforms, the politics. I get a wider view when I stand off&mdash;at home.
      I suppose it is more concentrated here. And, oh dear, I&rsquo;m so stupid!
      Everybody is so alert in little things, so quick to turn a compliment, and
      say a bright thing. While I am getting ready to say what I really think
      about Browning, for instance, he is disposed of in a sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because you try to say what you really think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one don&rsquo;t, what&rsquo;s the use of talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to pass the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret looked up to see if Henderson was serious. There was a smile of
      amusement on his face, but not at all offensive, because the woman saw
      that it was a look of interest also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be serious any more,&rdquo; she said, as there was a movement to
      quit the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That lays the responsibility on me of being serious,&rdquo; he replied, in the
      same light tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later they were wandering through the picture-gallery together. A gallery
      of modern pictures appeals for the most part to the senses&mdash;represents
      the pomps, the color, the allurements of life. It struck Henderson
      forcibly that this gallery, which he knew well, appeared very different
      looking at it with Miss Debree from what it would if he had been looking
      at it with Miss Eschelle. There were some pictures that he hurried past,
      some technical excellences only used for sensuous effects&mdash;that he
      did not call attention to as he might have done with another. Curiously
      enough, he found himself seeking sentiment, purity. If the drawing was
      bad, Margaret knew it; if a false note was struck, she saw it. But she was
      not educated up to a good many of the suggestions of the gallery.
      Henderson perceived this, and his manner to her became more deferential
      and protective. It was a manner to which every true woman responds, and
      Margaret was happy, more herself, and talked with a freedom and gayety, a
      spice of satire, and a note of reality that made her every moment more
      attractive to her companion. In her, animation the charm of her unworn
      beauty blazed upon him with a direct personal appeal. He hardly cared to
      conceal his frank admiration. She, on her part, was thinking, what could
      Miss Eschelle mean by saying that she was afraid of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the world seem any larger here, Miss Debree?&rdquo; he asked, as they had
      lingeringly made the circuit of the room and passed out through the
      tropical conservatory to join the rest of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;away from people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is not numbers, I am glad to know, that make a world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply. But when he encountered her, robed for departure, at
      the foot of the stairway, she gave him her hand in good-night, and their
      eyes met for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder if that was the time? Probably not. I fancy that when the right
      day came she confessed that the moment was when she first saw him enter
      their box at the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson walked down the avenue slowly, hearing the echo of his own steps
      in the deserted street. He was in no haste to reach home. It was such a
      delightful evening-snowing a little, and cold, but so exhilarating. He
      remembered just how she turned her head as she got into the carriage. She
      had touched his arm lightly once in the gallery to call his attention to a
      picture. Yes, the world was larger, larger, by one, and it would seem
      large&mdash;her image came to him distinctly&mdash;if she were the only
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was under the spell of this evening when the next, in response
      to a note asking him to call for a moment on business, he was shown into
      the Eschelle drawing-room. It was dimly lighted, but familiarity with the
      place enabled him without difficulty to find his way down the long suite,
      rather overcrowded with luxurious furniture, statuary, and pictures on
      easels, to the little library at the far end glowing in a rosy light.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, ensconced in a big chair, a book in her hand, one pretty foot on
      the fender, sat Carmen, in a grayish, vaporous toilet, which took a warm
      hue from the color of the spreading lamp-shades. On the carved table near
      was a litter of books and of nameless little articles, costly and
      coquettish, which assert femininity, even in a literary atmosphere. Over
      the fireplace hung a picture of spring&mdash;a budding girl, smiling and
      winning, in a semi-transparent raiment, advancing with swift steps to
      bring in the season of flowers and of love. The hand that held the book
      rested upon the arm of the chair, a finger inserted in the place where she
      had been reading, her rounded white arm visible to the elbow, and Carmen
      was looking into the fire in the attitude of reflection upon a suggestive
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women have so many forms of attraction, different women are attractive in
      so many different ways, moods are so changing, beauty is so undefinable,
      and has so many weapons. And yet men are called inconstant!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until Henderson had time to take in the warmth of this domestic
      picture that Carmen rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so good of you to come, with all your engagements. Mamma is excused
      with a headache, but she has left me power of attorney to ask questions
      about our little venture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the attorney will not put me through a cross-examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon how you have been behaving, Mr. Henderson. I&rsquo;m not very
      cross yet. Now, sit there so that I can look at you and see how honest you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to put on my business or my evening expression?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the first, if you mean business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your stocks are going up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice. You are so lucky! Everything goes up with you. Do you know
      what they say of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing bad, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That everything you touch turns to gold. That you will be one of the
      nabobs of New York in ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a startling destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; The girl seemed very serious. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like you
      to be distinguished. To be in the Cabinet. To be minister&mdash;go to
      England. But one needs a great deal of money for that, to go as one ought
      to go. What a career is open to a man in this country if he has money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t care for politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does? But position. You can afford that if you have money enough. Do
      you know, Mr. Henderson, I think you are dull.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I reckoned you&rsquo;d find it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other night at the Nestor ball a lady&mdash;no, I won&rsquo;t tell you who
      she is&mdash;asked me if I knew who that man was across the room; such an
      air of distinction; might be the new British Minister. You know, I almost
      blushed when I said I did know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what people expect of you. When a man looks distinguished and is
      clever, and knows how to please if he likes, he cannot help having a
      career, unless he is afraid to take the chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was not conscious of ever being wanting in this direction. The
      picture conjured up by the ingenious girl was not unfamiliar to his mind,
      and he understood quite well the relation to it that Carmen had in her
      mind; but he did not take the lead offered. Instead, he took refuge in the
      usual commonplace, and asked, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have been a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven forbid! I should be too wicked. It is responsibility enough to be
      a woman. I did not expect such a banality from you. Do you think, Mr.
      Henderson, we had better sell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our stocks. You are so occupied that I thought they might fall when you
      are up in the clouds somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall not forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, such things happen. I might forget you if it were not for the
      stocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall keep the stocks, even if they fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we should both fall together. That would be some compensation. Not
      much. Going to smash with you would be something like going to church with
      Mr. Lyon. It might have a steadying effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has come over you tonight, Carmen?&rdquo; Henderson asked, leaning forward
      with an expression of half amusement, half curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t that astonish you?&mdash;about life. It
      is very serious. I got some new views talking with that Miss Debree from
      Brandon. Chiefly from what she didn&rsquo;t say. She is such a lovely girl, and
      just as unsophisticated&mdash;well, as we are. I fear I shocked her by
      telling her your opinion of French novels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell her that I approved of all the French novels you read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! I didn&rsquo;t say you approved of any. It sort of came out that you
      knew about them. She is so downright and conscientious. I declare I felt
      virtuous shivers running all over me all the time I was with her. I&rsquo;m
      conscientious myself. I want everybody to know the worst of me. I wish I
      could practice some concealment. But she rather discourages me. She would
      take the color out of a career. She somehow doesn&rsquo;t allow for color, I
      could see. Duty, duty&mdash;that is the way she looks at life. She&rsquo;d try
      to keep me up to it; no playing by the way. I liked her very much. I like
      people not to have too much toleration. She would be just the wife for
      some nice country rector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought to tell her your plan for her? I dined with her last
      night at the Stotts&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Carmen had been wondering if he would tell her of that. &ldquo;Was it
      very dull?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very. There was music, distant enough not to interfere with
      conversation, and the gallery afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been very exhilarating. You talked about the Duchess of
      Bolinbroke, and the opera, and Prince Talleyrand, and the corner in wheat&mdash;dear
      me, I know, so decorous! And you said Miss Debree was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the honor of taking her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Henderson&rdquo;&mdash;the girl had risen to adjust the lamp-shade, and now
      stood behind his chair with her arm resting on it, so that he was obliged
      to turn his head backward to see her&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Henderson, do you know you
      are getting to be a desperate flirt?&rdquo; The laughing eyes looking into his
      said that was not such a desperate thing to do if he chose the right
      object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who taught me?&rdquo; He raised his left hand. She did not respond to the
      overture, except to snap the hand with her index-finger, and was back in
      her chair again, regarding him demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we shall go abroad soon.&rdquo; The little foot was on the fender
      again, and the face had the look of melancholy resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave Mr. Lyon without any protection here?&rdquo; The remark was made in a
      tone of good-humored raillery, but for some reason it seemed to sting the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How can you talk such nonsense? You,&rdquo; and she rose to
      her feet in indignation&mdash;&ldquo;you to advise an American girl to sell
      herself for a title&mdash;the chance of a title. I&rsquo;m ashamed of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Carmen,&rdquo; he replied, flushing, &ldquo;I advised nothing of the sort. I
      hadn&rsquo;t the least idea. I don&rsquo;t care a straw for Mr. Lyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it; you don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; sinking into her seat, still unappeased.
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll tell Mr. Lyon that he will have occupation enough to keep
      him in this country if he puts his money into that scheme you were talking
      over the other night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was in turn annoyed. &ldquo;You can tell him anything you like. I&rsquo;m no
      more responsible for his speculations than for his domestic concerns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are offended. It&rsquo;s not nice of you to put me in the wrong when
      you know how impulsive I am. I wish I didn&rsquo;t let my feelings run away with
      me.&rdquo; This said reflectively, and looking away from him. And then, turning
      towards him with wistful, pleading eyes: &ldquo;Do you know, I sometimes wish I
      had never seen you. You have so much power to make a person very bad or
      very good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Henderson, rising, &ldquo;we mustn&rsquo;t quarrel about an
      Englishman&mdash;such old friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are very old friends.&rdquo; The girl rose also, and gave him her hand.
      &ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s the worst of it. If I should lose your esteem I should go
      into a convent.&rdquo; She dropped his hand, and snatching a bunch of violets
      from the table, fixed them in his button-hole, looking up in his face with
      vestal sweetness. &ldquo;You are not offended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit; not the least in the world,&rdquo; said Henderson, heartily, patting
      the hand that still lingered upon his lapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Carmen sank into her chair with a gesture of vexation,
      and there were hard lines in her sweet face. &ldquo;What an insensible stick!&rdquo;
       Then she ran up-stairs to her mother, who sat in her room reading one of
      the town-weeklies, into which some elderly ladies look for something to
      condemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a stupid evening! He is just absorbed in that girl from Brandon. I
      told him we were going abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going abroad! You are crazy, child. New York is forty times as amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And forty times as tiresome. I&rsquo;m sick of it. Mamma, don&rsquo;t you think it
      would be only civil to ask Mr. Lyon to a quiet dinner before he goes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. That is what I said the other day. I thought you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was ill-natured then. But I want to please you. And we really
      ought to be civil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day is so like another in the city. Every day something new, and, the
      new the same thing over again. And always the expectation that it will be
      different tomorrow. Nothing is so tiresome as a kaleidoscope, though it
      never repeats itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately there are two pursuits that never pall&mdash;making money and
      making love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson had a new object in life, though the new one did not sensibly
      divert him from the old; it rather threw a charming light over it, and
      made the possibilities of it more attractive. In all his schemes he found
      the thought of Margaret entering. Why should it not have been Carmen? he
      sometimes thought. She thoroughly understood him. She would never stand in
      the way of his most daring ambitions with any scruples. Her conscience
      would never nag his. She would be ambitious for a career for him. Would
      she care for him or the career? How clever she was! And affectionate? She
      would be if she had a heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not balancing the two. What man ever does, in fact? It was simply
      because Margaret had a heart that he loved her, that she seemed necessary
      to him. He was quite capable of making a match for his advancement, but he
      felt strong enough to make one for his own pleasure. And if there are men
      so worldly as not to be attracted to unworldliness in a woman, Henderson
      was not one of them. If his heart had not dictated, his brain would have
      told him the value of the sympathy of a good woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very busy man, in the thick of the struggle for a great fortune.
      It did not occur to him to reflect whether she would approve all the
      methods he resorted to, but all the women he knew liked success, and the
      thought of her invigorated him. If she once loved him, she would approve
      what he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw much of her in those passing days&mdash;days that went like a dream
      to one of them at least. He was a welcome guest at the Arbusers&rsquo;, but he
      saw little of Margaret alone. It did not matter. A chance look is a
      volume; a word is a library. They saw each other; they heard each other.
      And then passion grows almost as well in the absence as in the presence of
      the object. Imagination then has free play. A little separation sometimes
      will fan it into a flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days went by, and Margaret&rsquo;s visit was over. I am obliged to say that
      the leave-taking was a gay one, as full of laughter as it was of hope.
      Brandon was such a little way off. Henderson often had business there. The
      Misses Arbuser said, &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; And Margaret said he must not forget
      that she lived there. Even when she bade her entertainers an affectionate
      good-by, she could not look very unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring was coming. That day in the cars there were few signs of it on the
      roadside to be seen, but the buds were swelling. And Margaret, neglecting
      the book which lay on her lap, and looking out the window, felt it in all
      her veins.

    <p>
      It is said that the world is created anew for every person who is in love.
      There is therefore this constant miracle of a new heavens and a new earth.
      It does not depend upon the seasons. The subtle force which is in every
      human being, more or less active, has this power, as if love were somehow
      a principle pervading nature itself, and capable of transforming it. Is
      this a divine gift? Can it be used more than once? Once spent, does the
      world to each succeeding experimenter in it become old and stale? We say
      the world is old. In one sense, the real sense to every person, it is no
      older than the lives lived in it at any given time. If it is always
      passing away, it is always being renewed. Every time a youth looks love in
      a maiden&rsquo;s eyes, and sees the timid appealing return of the universal
      passion, the world for those two is just as certainly created as it was on
      the first morning, in all its color, odor, song, freshness, promise. This
      is the central mystery of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously to herself, Margaret had worked this miracle. Never before
      did the little town look so bright; never before was there exactly such a
      color on the hills-sentiment is so pale compared with love; never before
      did her home appear so sweet; never before was there such a fine ecstasy
      in the coming of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all this, home-coming, after the first excitement of arrival is over,
      is apt to be dull. The mind is so occupied with other emotions that the
      friends even seem a little commonplace and unresponsive, and the routine
      is tame. Out of such a whirl of new experiences to return and find that
      nothing has happened; that the old duties and responsibilities are
      waiting! Margaret had eagerly leaped from the carriage to throw herself
      into her aunt&rsquo;s arms-what a sweet welcome it is, that of kin!&mdash;and
      yet almost before the greeting was over she felt alone. There was that in
      the affectionate calmness of Miss Forsythe that seemed to chill the glow
      and fever of passion in her new world. And she had nothing to tell.
      Everything had changed, and she must behave as if nothing had happened.
      She must take up her old life&mdash;the interests of the neighborhood.
      Even the little circle of people she loved appeared distant from her at
      the moment; impossible it seemed to bring them into the rushing current of
      her life. Their joy in getting her back again she could not doubt, nor the
      personal affection with which she was welcomed. But was the New England
      atmosphere a little cold? What was the flavor she missed in it all? The
      next day a letter came. The excuse for it was the return of a fan which
      Mr. Henderson had carried off in his pocket from the opera. What a
      wonderful letter it was&mdash;his handwriting, the first note from him!
      Miss Forsythe saw in it only politeness. For Margaret it outweighed the
      town of Brandon. It lay in her lap as she sat at her chamber window
      looking out over the landscape, which was beginning to be flushed with a
      pale green. There was a robin on the lawn, and a blackbird singing in the
      pine. &ldquo;Go not, happy day,&rdquo; she said, with tears in her eyes. She took up
      the brief letter and read it again. Was he really hers, &ldquo;truly&rdquo;? And she
      answered the letter, swiftly and with no hesitation, but with a throbbing
      heart. It was a civil acknowledgment; that was all. Henderson might have
      lead it aloud in the Exchange. But what color, what charming turns of
      expression, what of herself, had the girl put into it, that gave him such
      a thrill of pleasure when he read it? What secret power has a woman to
      make a common phrase so glow with her very self?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was something in her life that was her own, a secret, a hope, and yet
      a tremulous anticipation to be guarded almost from herself. It colored
      everything; it was always, whatever she was doing or saying, present, like
      an air that one unconsciously hums for days after it has caught his fancy.
      Blessed be the capacity of being fond and foolish! If that letter was
      under her pillow at night, if this new revelation was last in her thought
      as she fell asleep, if it mingled with the song of the birds in the spring
      morning, as some great good pervading the world, is there anything
      distinguishing in such an experience that it should be dwelt on? And if
      there were questionings and little panics of doubt, did not these moments
      also reveal Margaret to herself more certainly than the hours of happy
      dreaming?
    </p>
    <p>
      Questionings no doubt there were, and, later, serious questionings; for
      habit is almost as strong as love, and the old ways of life and of thought
      will reassert themselves in a thoughtful mind, and reason will insist on
      analyzing passion and even hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the home life and every-day interests began to assume their
      natural aspect and proportions. It was so sweet and sane, this home life,
      interesting and not feverish. There was time for reading, time for turning
      over things in the mind, time for those interchanges of feeling and of
      ideas, by the fireside; she was not required to be always on dress parade,
      in mind or person, always keyed up to make an impression or receive one;
      how much wider and sounder was Morgan&rsquo;s view of the world, allowing for
      his kindly cynicism, than that prevalent in the talk where she had lately
      been! How sincere and hearty and free ran the personal currents in this
      little neighborhood! In the very fact that the daily love and affection
      for her and interest in her were taken for granted she realized the
      difference between her position here and that among newer friends who
      showed more open admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little there was a readjustment. In comparison, the city life,
      with its intensity of action and feeling, began to appear distant, not so
      real, mixed, turbid, even frivolous. And was Henderson a vanishing part of
      this pageant? Was his figure less distinct as the days went by? It could
      not be affirmed. Love is such a little juggler, and likes, now and again,
      to pretend to be so reasonable and judicious. There were no more letters.
      If there had been a letter now and then, on any excuse, the nexus would
      have been more distinct: nothing feeds the flame exactly like a letter; it
      has intention, personality, secrecy. And the little excitement of it
      grows. Once a week gets to be twice a week, three times, four times, and
      then daily. And then a day without a letter is such a blank, and so full
      of fear! What can have happened? Is he ill? Has he changed? The opium
      habit is nothing to the letter habit-between lovers. Not that Margaret
      expected a letter. Indeed, reason told her that it had not gone so far as
      that. But she should see him. She felt sure of that. And the thought
      filled all the vacant places in her imagination of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet she thought she was seeing him more clearly than when he was with
      her. Oh wise young woman! She fancied she was deliberating, looking at
      life with great prudence. It must be one&rsquo;s own fault if one makes a
      radical mistake in marriage. She was watching the married people about her
      with more interest-the Morgans, our own household, Mrs. Fletcher; and
      besides, her aunt, whose even and cheerful life lacked this experience. It
      is so wise to do this, to keep one&rsquo;s feelings in control, not to be too
      hasty! Everybody has these intervals of prudence. That is the reason there
      are so few mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dare say that all these reflections and deliberations in the maidenly
      mind were almost unconscious to herself; certainly unacknowledged. It was
      her imagination that she was following, and scarcely a distinct reality or
      intention. She thought of Henderson, and he gave a certain personality,
      vivid maybe, to that dream of the future which we all in youth indulge;
      but she would have shrunk from owning this even to herself. We deceive
      ourselves as often as we deceive others. Margaret would have repudiated
      with some warmth any intimation that she had lost her heart, and was
      really predicting the practical possibilities of that loss, and she would
      have been quite honest with herself in thinking that she was still
      mistress of her own feeling. Later on she would know, and delight to
      confess, that her destiny was fixed at a certain hour, at a certain
      moment, in New York, for subsequent events would run back to that like
      links in a chain. And she would have been right and also wrong in that;
      for but for those subsequent events the first impression would have faded,
      and been taken little account of in her life. I am more and more convinced
      that men and women act more upon impulse and less upon deep reflection and
      self-examination than the analytic novelists would have us believe, duly
      weighing motives and balancing considerations; and that men and women know
      themselves much less thoroughly than they suppose they do. There is a
      great deal of exaggeration, I am convinced, about the inward struggles and
      self-conflicts. The reader may know that Margaret was hopelessly in love,
      because he knows everything; but that charming girl would have been
      shocked and wounded to the most indignant humiliation if she had fancied
      that her friends thought that. Nay, more, if Henderson had at this moment
      made by letter a proposal for her hand, her impulse would have been to
      repudiate the offer as unjustified by anything that had taken place, and
      she would no doubt have obeyed that impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something occurred, while she was in this mood, that did not shock her
      maidenly self-consciousness, nor throw her into antagonism, but which did
      bring her face to face with a possible reality. And this was simply the
      receipt of a letter from Henderson; not a love-letter&mdash;far enough
      from that&mdash;but one in which there was a certain tone and intention
      that the most inexperienced would recognize as possibly serious. Aside
      from the announcement in the letter, the very fact of writing it was
      significant, conveying an intimation that the reader might be interested
      in what concerned the writer. The letter was longer than it need have
      been, for one thing, as if the pen, once started on its errand, ran on con
      amore. The writer was coming to Brandon; business, to be sure, was the
      excuse; but why should it have been necessary to announce to her a
      business visit? There crept into the letter somehow a good deal about his
      daily life, linked, to be sure, with mention of places and people in which
      she had recently an interest. He had been in Washington, and there were
      slight sketches of well-known characters in Congress and in the
      Government; he had been in Chicago, and even as far as Denver, and there
      were little pictures of scenes that might amuse her. There was no special
      mystery about all this travel and hurrying from place to place, but it
      gave Margaret a sense of varied and large occupations that she did not
      understand. Through it all there was the personality that had been
      recently so much in her thoughts. He was coming. That was a very solid
      fact that she must meet. And she did not doubt that he was coming to see
      her, and soon. That was a definite and very different idea from the dim
      belief that he would come some time. He had signed himself hers
      &ldquo;faithfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a letter that could not be answered like the other one; for it
      raised questions and prospects, and the thousand doubts that make one
      hesitate in any definite step; and, besides, she pleased herself to think
      that she did not know her own mind. He had not asked if he might come; he
      had said he was coming, and really there was no answer to that. Therefore
      she put it out of her mind-another curious mental process we have in
      dealing with a matter that is all the time the substratum of our
      existence. And she was actually serious; if she was reflective, she was
      conscious of being judicially reflective.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this period of calm and reflection it was impossible that a woman
      of Margaret&rsquo;s habits and temperament should not attempt to settle in her
      mind what that life was yonder of which she had a little taste; what was
      the career that Henderson had marked out for himself; what were his
      principles; what were the methods and reasons of his evident success.
      Endeavoring in her clear mind to separate the person, about whose
      personality she was so fondly foolish, from his schemes, which she so
      dimly comprehended, and applying to his somewhat hazy occupations her
      simple moral test, were the schemes quite legitimate? Perhaps she did not
      go so far as this; but what she read in the newspapers of moneymaking in
      these days made her secretly uneasy, and she found herself wishing that he
      were definitely practicing some profession, or engaged in some one solid
      occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little parliament at our house, where everything, first and last,
      was overhauled and brought to judgment, without, it must be confessed, any
      visible effect on anything, one evening a common &ldquo;incident&rdquo; of the day
      started the conversation. It was an admiring account in a newspaper of a
      brilliant operation by which three or four men had suddenly become
      millionaires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said my wife, &ldquo;any mention in this account of the thousands
      who have been reduced to poverty by this operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morgan; &ldquo;that is not interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would be very interesting to me,&rdquo; Mrs. Fletcher remarked. &ldquo;Is
      there any protection, Mr. Morgan, for people who have invested their
      little property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose your money is all invested, say in a railway, and something
      goes wrong, where are you to get the money to pay for the law that will
      give you restitution? Is there anything in the State, or public opinion,
      or anywhere, that will protect your interests against clever swindling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; Morgan admitted. &ldquo;You take your chance when you let
      your money go out of your stocking. You see there are so many people who
      want it. You can put it in the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I own the ground I put it in, the voters who have no ground will
      tax it till there is nothing left for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is equality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t equality, for somebody gets very rich in railways or lands,
      while we lose our little all. Don&rsquo;t you think there ought to be a public
      official whose duty it is to enforce the law gratis which I cannot afford
      to enforce when I am wronged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The difficulty is to discover whether you are wronged or only
      unfortunate. It needs a lawyer to find that out. And very likely if you
      are wronged, the wrongdoer has so cleverly gone round the law that it
      needs legislation to set you straight, and that needs a lobbyist, whom the
      lawyer must hire, or he must turn lobbyist himself. Now, a lawyer costs
      money, and a lobbyist is one of the most expensive of modern luxuries; but
      when you have a lawyer and lobbyist in one, you will find it economical to
      let him take your claim and all that can be made out of it, and not bother
      you any more about it. But there is no doubt about the law, as I said. You
      can get just as much law as you can pay for. It is like any other
      commodity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that the lawyer takes what the operator
      leaves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly. There is a great deal of unreasonable prejudice against
      lawyers. They must live. There is no nobler occupation than the
      application of the principle of justice in human affairs. The trouble is
      that public opinion sustains the operator in his smartness, and estimates
      the lawyer according to his adroitness. If we only evoked the aid of a
      lawyer in a just cause, the lawyers would have less to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usually and naturally the best talent goes with the biggest fees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said my wife, musing along, in her way, on parallel
      lines, &ldquo;that there ought to be a limit to the amount of property one man
      can get into his absolute possession, to say nothing of the methods by
      which he gets it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That never yet could be set,&rdquo; Morgan replied. &ldquo;It is impossible for any
      number of men to agree on it. I don&rsquo;t see any line between absolute
      freedom of acquisition, trusting to circumstances, misfortune, and death
      to knock things to pieces, and absolute slavery, which is communism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe, Mr. Morgan, that any vast fortune was ever honestly come
      by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is another question. Honesty is such a flexible word. If you mean a
      process the law cannot touch, yes. If you mean moral consideration for
      others, I doubt. But property accumulates by itself almost. Many a man who
      has got a start by an operation he would not like to have investigated,
      and which he tries to forget, goes on to be very rich, and has a daily
      feeling of being more and more honorable and respectable, using only means
      which all the world calls fair and shrewd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Morgan,&rdquo; suddenly asked Margaret, who had been all the time an uneasy
      listener to the turn the talk had taken, &ldquo;what is railroad wrecking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is very simple, at least in some of its forms. The &lsquo;wreckers,&rsquo; as
      they are called, fasten upon some railway that is prosperous, pays
      dividends, pays a liberal interest on its bonds, and has a surplus. They
      contrive to buy, no matter of what cost, a controlling interest in it,
      either in its stock or its management. Then they absorb its surplus; they
      let it run down so that it pays no dividends, and by-and-by cannot even
      pay its interest; then they squeeze the bondholders, who may be glad to
      accept anything that is offered out of the wreck, and perhaps then they
      throw the property into the hands of a receiver, or consolidate it with
      some other road at a value enormously greater than the cost to them in
      stealing it. Having in one way or another sucked it dry, they look round
      for another road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all the people who first invested lose their money, or the most of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally, the little fish get swallowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is infamous,&rdquo; said Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;infamous! And men go to work to do
      this, to get other people&rsquo;s property, in cool blood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how cool, but it is in the way of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the difference between that and getting possession of a bank and
      robbing it?&rdquo; she asked, hot with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one is an operation, and the other is embezzlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shame. How can people permit it? Suppose, Mrs. Fletcher, a
      wrecker should steal your money that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I never saw Margaret more disturbed&mdash;out of all proportion, I
      thought, to the cause; for we had talked a hundred times about such
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think all men who are what you call operating around are like
      that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Probably most men who are engaged in what is generally
      called speculation are doing what seems to them a perfectly legitimate
      business. It is a common way of making a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Margaret,&rdquo; Morgan explained, &ldquo;when people in trade buy anything,
      they expect to sell it for more than they gave for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Margaret replied, more calmly, &ldquo;that a great deal of
      what you men call business is just trying to get other people&rsquo;s money, and
      doesn&rsquo;t help anybody or produce anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is keeping up the circulation, preventing stagnation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is the use of brokers in grain and stocks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly. They are commonly the agents that others use to keep themselves
      from stagnation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see any good in it,&rdquo; Margaret persisted. &ldquo;No one seems to have
      the things he buys or sells. I don&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because you are a woman, if you will pardon me for saying it. Men
      don&rsquo;t need to have things in hand; business is done on faith and credit,
      and when a transaction is over, they settle up and pay the difference,
      without the trouble of transporting things back and forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you are chaffing me, Mr. Morgan. But I should call that betting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is a risk in everything you do. But you see it is really paying
      for a difference of knowledge or opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you buy stocks that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, agreeing to pay for your difference of opinion, as you call it, not
      really having any stock at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did. But I have bought stocks and sold them pretty soon, if I
      could make anything by the sale. All merchants act on that principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Margaret, dimly seeing the sophistry of this, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      understand business morality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody does, Margaret. Most men go by the law. The Golden Rule seems to
      be suspended by a more than two-thirds vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was by such inquiries, leading to many talks of this sort, that
      Margaret was groping in her mind for the solution of what might become to
      her a personal question. Consciously she did not doubt Henderson&rsquo;s
      integrity or his honor, but she was perplexed about the world of which she
      had recently had a glimpse, and it was impossible to separate him from it.
      Subjected to an absolutely new experience, stirred as her heart had never
      been before by any man&mdash;a fact which at once irritated and pleased
      her&mdash;she was following the law of her own nature, while she was still
      her own mistress, to ponder these things and to bring her reason to the
      guidance of her feeling. And it is probable that she did not at all know
      the strength of her feeling, or have any conception of the real power of
      love, and how little the head has to do with the great passion of life,
      the intensity of which the poets have never in the least exaggerated. If
      she thought of Mr. Lyon occasionally, of his white face and pitiful look
      of suffering that day, she could not, after all, make it real or
      permanently serious. Indeed, she was sure that no emotion could so master
      her. And yet she looked forward to Henderson&rsquo;s coming with a sort of
      nervous apprehension, amounting almost to dread.

      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the susceptible time of the year for plants, for birds, for maids:
      all innocent natural impulses respond to the subtle influence of spring.
      One may well gauge his advance in selfishness, worldliness, and sin by his
      loss of this annual susceptibility, by the failure of this sweet appeal to
      touch his heart. One must be very far gone if some note of it does not for
      a moment bring back the tenderest recollections of the days of joyous
      innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the city, with its mass of stone and brick, rectangles, straight
      lines, dust, noise, and fever of activity, is penetrated by this divine
      suggestion of the renewal of life. You can scarcely open a window without
      letting in a breath of it; the south wind, the twitter of a sparrow, the
      rustle of leaves in the squares, the smell of the earth and of some
      struggling plant in the area, the note of a distant hand-organ softened by
      distance, are begetting a longing for youth, for green fields, for love.
      As Carmen walked down the avenue with Mr. Lyon on a spring morning she
      almost made herself believe that an unworldly life with this
      simple-hearted gentleman&mdash;when he should come into his title and
      estate&mdash;would be more to her liking than the most brilliant success
      in place and power with Henderson. Unfortunately the spring influence also
      suggested the superior attractiveness of the only man who had ever taken
      her shallow fancy. And unfortunately the same note of nature suggested to
      Mr. Lyon the contrast of this artificial piece of loveliness with the
      domestic life of which he dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Margaret, she opened her heart to the spring without reserve. It
      was May. The soft maples had a purple tinge, the chestnuts showed color,
      the apple-trees were in bloom (all the air was full of their perfume), the
      blackbirds were chattering in convention in the tall oaks, the bright
      leaves and the flowering shrubs were alive with the twittering and singing
      of darting birds. The soft, fleecy clouds, hovering as over a world just
      created, seemed to make near and participant in the scene the delicate
      blue of the sky. Margaret&mdash;I remember the morning&mdash;was standing
      on her piazza, as I passed through the neighborhood drive, with a spray of
      apple-blossoms in her hand. For the moment she seemed to embody all the
      maiden purity of the scene, all its promise. I said, laughing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have to have you painted as spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But spring isn&rsquo;t painted at all,&rdquo; she replied, holding up the apple&mdash;blossoms,
      and coming down the piazza with a dancing step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it won&rsquo;t last. We want something permanent,&rdquo; I was beginning to
      say, when a carriage passed, going to our house. &ldquo;I think that must be
      Henderson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed. Her sunny face clouded at once, and she turned to go
      in as I hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Henderson, and there was at least pretense enough of business
      to occupy us, with Mr. Morgan, the greater part of the day. It was not
      till late in the afternoon that Henderson appeared to remember that
      Margaret was in the neighborhood, and spoke of his intention of calling.
      My wife pointed out the way to him across the grounds, and watched him
      leisurely walking among the trees till he was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an agreeable man Mr. Henderson is!&rdquo; she said, turning to me; &ldquo;most
      companionable; and yet&mdash;and yet, my dear, I&rsquo;m glad he is not my
      husband. You suit me very well.&rdquo; There was an air of conviction about this
      remark, as if it were the result of deep reflection and comparison, and it
      was emphasized by the little possessory act of readjusting my necktie&mdash;one
      of the most subtle of female flatteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who wanted him to be your husband?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Married women have the
      oddest habit of going about the world picking out the men they would not
      like to have married. Do they need continually to justify themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they congratulate themselves. You never can understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I cannot. My first thought about an attractive woman whose
      acquaintance I make is not that I am glad I did not marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say not. You are all inconsistent, you men. But you are the least
      so of any man in the world, I do believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to say whether the spring morning seemed more or
      less glorious to Margaret when she went indoors, but its serenity was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like the premonition in nature of a change. She put the apple
      blossoms in water and placed the jug on the table, turning it about half a
      dozen times, moving her head from side to side to get the effect. When it
      was exactly right, she said to her aunt, who sat sewing in the bay-window,
      in a perfectly indifferent tone, &ldquo;Mr. Fairchild just passed here, and said
      that Mr. Henderson had come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Her aunt did not lift her eyes from her work, or appear to attach
      the least importance to this tremendous piece of news. Margaret was
      annoyed at what seemed to her an assumed indifference. Her nerves were
      quivering with the knowledge that he had arrived, that he was in the next
      house, that he might be here any moment&mdash;the man who had entered into
      her whole life&mdash;and the announcement was no more to her aunt than if
      she had said it rained. She was provoked at herself that she should be so
      disturbed, yes, annoyed, at his proximity. She wished he had not come&mdash;not
      today, at any rate. She looked about for something to do, and began to
      rearrange this and that trifle in the sitting-room, which she had
      perfectly arranged once before in the morning, moving about here and there
      in a rather purposeless manner, until her aunt looked up and for a moment
      followed her movements till Margaret left the room. In her own chamber she
      sat by the window and tried to think, but there was no orderly mental
      process; in vain she tried to run over in her mind the past month and all
      her reflections and wise resolves. She heard the call of the birds, she
      inhaled the odor of the new year, she was conscious of all that was
      gracious and inviting in the fresh scene, but in her sub-consciousness
      there was only one thought&mdash;he was there, he was coming. She took up
      her sewing, but the needle paused in the stitch, and she found herself
      looking away across the lawn to the hills; she took up a book, but the
      words had no meaning, read and reread them as she would. He is there, he
      is coming. And what of it? Why should she be so disturbed? She was
      uncommitted, she was mistress of her own actions. Had she not been coolly
      judging his conduct? She despised herself for being so nervous and
      unsettled. If he was coming, why did he not come? Why was he waiting so
      long? She arose impatiently and went down-stairs. There was a necessity of
      doing something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there anything that you want from town, auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that I know of. Are you going in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, unless you have an errand. It is such a fine day that it seems a pity
      to stay indoors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I would walk if I were you.&rdquo; But she did not go; she went instead
      to her room. He might come any moment. She ought not to run away; and yet
      she wished she were away. He said he was coming on business. Was it not,
      then, a pretense? She felt humiliated in the idea of waiting for him if
      the business were not a pretense.
    </p>
    <p>
      How insensible men are! What a mere subordinate thing to them in life is
      the love of a woman! Yes, evidently business was more important to him
      than anything else. He must know that she was waiting; and she blushed to
      herself at the very possibility that he should think such a thing. She was
      not waiting. It was lunch-time. She excused herself. In the next moment
      she was angry that she had not gone down as usual. It was time for him to
      come. He would certainly come immediately after lunch. She would not see
      him. She hoped never to see him. She rose in haste, put on her hat, put it
      on carefully, turning and returning before the glass, selected fresh
      gloves, and ran down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, auntie, for a walk to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walk was a long one. She came back tired. It was late in the
      afternoon. Her aunt was quietly reading. She needed to ask her nothing:
      Mr. Henderson had not been there. Why had he written to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the Fairchilds want us to come over to dinner,&rdquo; said Miss Forsythe,
      without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will go, auntie. I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t mind being alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? It&rsquo;s perfectly informal. Mr. Henderson happens to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too stupid. But you must go. Mr. Henderson, in New York, expressed
      the greatest desire to make your acquaintance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Forsythe smiled. &ldquo;I suppose he has come up on purpose. But, dear, you
      must go to chaperon me. It would hardly be civil not to go, when you knew
      Mr. Henderson in New York, and the Fairchilds want to make it agreeable
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, auntie, it is just a business visit. I&rsquo;m too tired to make the
      effort. It must be this spring weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was. It is so unfortunate that the spring, which begets so many
      desires, brings the languor that defeats their execution. But there is a
      limit to the responsibility even of spring for a woman&rsquo;s moods. Just as
      Margaret spoke she saw, through the open window, Henderson coming across
      the lawn, walking briskly, but evidently not inattentive to the charm of
      the landscape. It was his springy step, his athletic figure, and, as he
      came nearer, the joyous anticipation in his face. And it was so sudden, so
      unexpected&mdash;the vision so long looked for! There was no time for
      flight, had she wanted to avoid him; he was on the piazza; he was at the
      open door. Her hand went quickly to her heart to still the rapid flutter,
      which might be from pain and might be from joy&mdash;she could not tell.
      She had imagined their possible meeting so many times, and it was not at
      all like this. She ought to receive him coldly, she ought to receive him
      kindly, she ought to receive him indifferently. But how real he was, how
      handsome he was! If she could have obeyed the impulse of the moment I am
      not sure but she would have fled, and cast herself face downward
      somewhere, and cried a little and thanked God for him. He was in the room.
      In his manner there was no hesitation, in his expression no uncertainty.
      His face beamed with pleasure, and there was so much open admiration in
      his eyes that Margaret, conscious of it to her heart&rsquo;s core, feared that
      her aunt would notice it. And she met him calmly enough, frankly enough.
      The quickness with which a woman can pull herself together under such
      circumstances is testimony to her superior fibre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking across here ever since morning,&rdquo; he said, as soon as
      the hand-shaking and introduction were over, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve only this minute
      been released.&rdquo; There was no air of apology in this, but a delicate
      intimation of impatience at the delay. And still, what an unconscious
      brute a man is!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought perhaps you had returned,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;until my aunt was
      just telling me we were asked to dine with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson gave her a quick glance. Was it possible she thought he could go
      away without seeing her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I was commissioned to bring you over when you are ready.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      will not keep you waiting long, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; interposed Miss Forsythe,
      out of the goodness of her heart. &ldquo;My niece has been taking a long walk,
      and this debilitating spring weather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, since the sun has gone away, I think I&rsquo;m quite up to the exertion,
      since you wish it, auntie,&rdquo; a speech that made Henderson stare again,
      wholly unable to comprehend the reason of an indirection which he could
      feel&mdash;he who had been all day impatient for this moment. There was a
      little talk about the country and the city at this season, mainly
      sustained by Miss Forsythe and Henderson, and then he was left alone. &ldquo;Of
      course you should go, Margaret,&rdquo; said her aunt, as they went upstairs; &ldquo;it
      would not be at all the thing for me to leave you here. And what a fine,
      manly, engaging fellow Mr. Henderson is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he acts very much like a man;&rdquo; and Margaret was gone into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go? There was not force enough in the commonwealth, without calling out
      the militia, to keep Margaret from going to the dinner. She stopped a
      moment in the middle of her chamber to think. She had almost forgotten how
      he looked&mdash;his eyes, his smile. Dear me! how the birds were singing
      outside, and how fresh the world was! And she would not hurry. He could
      wait. No doubt he would wait now any length of time for her. He was in the
      house, in the room below, perhaps looking out of the window, perhaps
      reading, perhaps spying about at her knick-knacks&mdash;she would like to
      look in at the door a moment to see what he was doing. Of course he was
      here to see her, and all the business was a pretext. As she sat a moment
      upon the edge of her bed reflecting what to put on, she had a little pang
      that she had been doing him injustice in her thought. But it was only for
      an instant. He was here. She was not in the least flurried. Indeed, her
      mental processes were never clearer than when she settled upon her simple
      toilet, made as it was in every detail with the sure instinct of a woman
      who dresses for her lover. Heavens! what a miserable day it had been, what
      a rebellious day! He ought to be punished for it somehow. Perhaps the rose
      she put in her hair was part of the punishment. But he should not see how
      happy she was; she would be civil, and just a little reserved; it was so
      like a man to make a woman wait all day and then think he could smooth it
      all over simply by appearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But somehow in Henderson&rsquo;s presence these little theories of conduct did
      not apply. He was too natural, direct, unaffected, his pleasure in being
      with her was so evident! He seemed to brush aside the little defenses and
      subterfuges. There was this about him that appeared to her admirable, and
      in contrast with her own hesitating indirection, that whatever he wanted&mdash;money,
      or position, or the love of woman&mdash;he went straight to his object
      with unconsciousness that failure was possible. Even in walking across the
      grounds in the soft sunset light, and chatting easily, their relations
      seemed established on a most natural basis, and Margaret found herself
      giving way to the simple enjoyment of the hour. She was not only happy,
      but her spirits rose to inexpressible gayety, which ran into the humor of
      badinage and a sort of spiritual elation, in which all things seemed
      possible. Perhaps she recognized in herself, what Henderson saw in her.
      And with it all there was an access of tenderness for her aunt, the dear
      thing whose gentle life appeared so colorless.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen Margaret so radiant as at the dinner; her high spirits
      infected the table, and the listening and the talking were of the best
      that the company could give. I remembered it afterwards, not from anything
      special that was said, but from its flow of high animal spirits, and the
      electric responsive mood everyone was in; no topic carried too far, and
      the chance seriousness setting off the sparkling comments on affairs.
      Henderson&rsquo;s talk had the notable flavor of direct contact with life, and
      very little of the speculative and reflective tone of Morgan&rsquo;s, who was
      always generalizing and theorizing about it. He had just come from the
      West, and his off-hand sketches of men had a special cynicism, not in the
      least condemnatory, mere good-natured acceptance, and in contrast to
      Morgan&rsquo;s moralizing and rather pitying cynicism. It struck me that he did
      not believe in his fellows as much as Morgan did; but I fancied that
      Margaret only saw in his attitude a tolerant knowledge of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the people on the border as bad as they are represented?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not much worse than they represent themselves,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I
      suppose the difference is that men feel less restraint there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is something more than that,&rdquo; added Morgan. &ldquo;There is a sort of
      drift-wood of adventure and devil-may-care-ism that civilization throws in
      advance of itself; but that isn&rsquo;t so bad as the slag it manufactures in
      the cities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember you said, Mr. Morgan, that men go West to get rid of their
      past,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As New Yorkers go to Europe to get rid of their future?&rdquo; Henderson
      inquired, catching the phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;Morgan turned to Margaret&mdash;&ldquo;doubtless there is a
      satisfaction sometimes in placing the width of a continent between a man
      and what he has done. I&rsquo;ve thought that one of the most popular verses in
      the Psalter, on the border, must be the one that says&mdash;you will know
      if I quote it right &lsquo;Look how wide also the East is from the West; so far
      hath He set our sins from us.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is dreadful,&rdquo; exclaimed Margaret. &ldquo;To think of you spending your
      time in the service picking out passages to fit other people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds as if you had manufactured it,&rdquo; was Henderson&rsquo;s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; that quiet Mr. Lyon pointed it out to me when we were talking about
      Montana. He had been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-way, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; my wife asked, &ldquo;do you know what has become
      of Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe he is about to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied Miss Eschelle might have something to say about that,&rdquo; Morgan
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, if she were asked. But Mr. Lyon appeared rather indifferent to
      American attractions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret looked quickly at Henderson as he said this, and then ventured, a
      little slyly, &ldquo;She seemed to appreciate his goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Miss Eschelle has an eye for goodness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was said without change of countenance, but it convinced the listener
      that Carmen was understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Margaret, with a little air of temerity, &ldquo;you seem to be
      very good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she is very charitable; she sees, I suppose, what is good in me; and
      I&rsquo;ll spare you the trouble of remarking that she must necessarily be very
      sharp-sighted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not going to destroy your illusion by telling you her real
      opinion of you,&rdquo; Margaret retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson begged to know what it was, but Margaret evaded the question by
      new raillery. What did she care at the moment what Carmen thought of
      Henderson? What&mdash;did either of them care what they were saying, so
      long as there was some personal flavor in the talk! Was it not enough to
      talk to each other, to see each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat afterwards upon the piazza with our cigars, inhaling the odor of
      the apple blossoms, and yielding ourselves, according to our age, to the
      influence of the mild night, Margaret was in the high spirits which
      accompany the expectation of bliss, without the sobering effect of its
      responsibility. Love itself is very serious, but the overture is full of
      freakish gayety. And it was all gayety that night. We all constituted
      ourselves a guard of honor to Miss Forsythe and Margaret when they went to
      their cottage, and there was a merry leave-taking in the moonlight. To be
      sure, Margaret walked with Henderson, and they lagged a little behind, but
      I had no reason to suppose that they were speaking of the stars, or that
      they raised the ordinary question of their being inhabited. I doubt if
      they saw the stars at all. How one remembers little trifles, that recur
      like the gay bird notes of the opening scenes that are repeated in the
      tragedy of the opera! I can see Margaret now, on some bantering pretext,
      running back, after we had said good-night, to give Henderson the
      blush-rose she had worn in her hair. How charming the girl was in this
      freakish action!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he is good enough for her?&rdquo; asked my wife, when we were
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is good enough for whom?&rdquo; I said, a yawn revealing my want of
      sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be stupid. You are not so blind as you pretend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if I am not so blind as I pretend, though I did not pretend to be
      blind, I suppose that is mainly her concern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wish she had cared for Lyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Lyon did not care for her,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never see anything. Lyon was a noble fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t deny that. But how was I to know about Lyon, my dear? I never
      heard you say that you were glad he wasn&rsquo;t your husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I think Henderson has very serious intentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he isn&rsquo;t frivolous,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are. It isn&rsquo;t a joking matter&mdash;and you pretend to be so
      fond of Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is another thing I pretend? What do you want me to do? Which one
      do you want me to make my enemy by telling him or her that the other isn&rsquo;t
      good enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to do anything, except to be reasonable, and
      sympathize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I sympathize all round. I assure you I&rsquo;ve no doubt you are quite
      right.&rdquo; And in this way I crawled out of the discussion, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a pretty simile it is, comparing life to a river, because rivers are
      so different! There are the calm streams that flow eagerly from the
      youthful sources, join a kindred flood, and go placidly to the sea, only
      broadening and deepening and getting very muddy at times, but without a
      rapid or a fall. There are others that flow carelessly in the upper
      sunshine, begin to ripple and dance, then run swiftly, and rush into
      rapids in which there is no escape (though friends stand weeping and
      imploring on the banks) from the awful plunge of the cataract. Then there
      is the tumult and the seething, the exciting race and rage through the
      canon, the whirlpools and the passions of love and revelations of
      character, and finally, let us hope, the happy emergence into the lake of
      a serene life. And the more interesting rivers are those that have tumults
      and experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew well enough before the next day was over that it was too late for
      the rescue of Margaret or Henderson. They were in the rapids, and would
      have rejected any friendly rope thrown to draw them ashore. And
      notwithstanding the doubts of my wife, I confess that I had so much
      sympathy with the genuineness of it that I enjoyed this shock of two
      strong natures rushing to their fate. Was it too sudden? Do two living
      streams hesitate when they come together? When they join they join, and
      mingle and reconcile themselves afterwards. It is only canals that flow
      languidly in parallel lines, and meet, if they meet at all, by the orderly
      contrivance of a lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the two were off for a stroll. There is a hill from which a
      most extensive prospect is had of the city, the teeming valley, with a
      score of villages and innumerable white spires, of forests and meadows and
      broken mountain ranges. It was a view that Margaret the night before had
      promised to show Henderson, that he might see what to her was the
      loveliest landscape in the world. Whether they saw the view I do not know.
      But I know the rock from which it is best seen, and could fancy Margaret
      sitting there, with her face turned towards it and her hands folded in her
      lap, and Henderson sitting, half turned away from it, looking in her face.
      There is an apple orchard just below. It was in bloom, and all the
      invitation of spring was in the air. That he saw all the glorious prospect
      reflected in her mobile face I do not doubt&mdash;all the nobility and
      tenderness of it. If I knew the faltering talk in that hour of growing
      confidence and expectation, I would not repeat it. Henderson lunched at
      the Forsythe&rsquo;s, and after lunch he had some talk with Miss Forsythe. It
      must have been of an exciting nature to her, for, immediately after, that
      good woman came over in a great flutter, and was closeted with my wife,
      who at the end of the interview had an air of mysterious importance. It
      was evidently a woman&rsquo;s day, and my advice was not wanted, even if my
      presence was tolerated. All I heard my wife say through the opening door,
      as the consultation ended, was, &ldquo;I hope she knows her own mind fully
      before anything is decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to the objects of this anxiety, they were upon the veranda of the
      cottage, quite unconscious of the necessity of digging into their own
      minds. He was seated, and she was leaning against the railing on which the
      honeysuckle climbed, pulling a flower in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is such a short time I have known you,&rdquo; she was saying, as if in
      apology for her own feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in one way;&rdquo; and he leaned forward, and broke his sentence with a
      little laugh. &ldquo;I think I must have known you in some pre-existent state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. And yet, in another way, it seems long&mdash;a whole month, you
      know.&rdquo; And the girl laughed a little in her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the longest month I ever knew, after you left the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it? I oughtn&rsquo;t to have said that first. But do you know, Mr.
      Henderson, you seem totally different from any other man I ever knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That this was a profound and original discovery there could be no doubt,
      from the conviction with which it was announced. &ldquo;I felt from the first
      that I could trust you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish&rdquo;&mdash;and there was genuine feeling in the tone&mdash;&ldquo;I were
      worthier of such a generous trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a wistful look in her face&mdash;timidity, self-depreciation,
      worship&mdash;as Henderson rose and stood near her, and she looked up
      while he took the broken flower from her hand. There was but one answer to
      this, and in spite of the open piazza and the all-observant, all-revealing
      day, it might have been given; but at the moment Miss Forsythe was seen
      hurrying towards them through the shrubbery. She came straight to where
      they stood, with an air of New England directness and determination. One
      hand she gave to Henderson, the other to Margaret. She essayed to speak,
      but tears were in her eyes, and her lips trembled; the words would not
      come. She regarded them for an instant with all the overflowing affection
      of a quarter of a century of repression, and then quickly turned and went
      in. In a moment they followed her. Heaven go with them!
    </p>
    <p>
      After Henderson had made his hasty adieus at our house and gone, before
      the sun was down, Margaret came over. She came swiftly into the room, gave
      me a kiss as I rose to greet her, with a delightful impersonality, as if
      she owed a debt somewhere and must pay it at once&mdash;we men who are so
      much left out of these affairs have occasionally to thank Heaven for a
      merciful moment&mdash;seized my wife, and dragged her to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t wait another moment,&rdquo; she said, as she threw herself on my
      wife&rsquo;s bosom in a passion of tears. &ldquo;I am so happy! he is so noble, and I
      love him so!&rdquo; And she sobbed as if it were the greatest calamity in the
      world. And then, after a little, in reply to a question&mdash;for women
      are never more practical than in such a crisis: &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;not for a
      long, long, long time. Not before autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the girl looked, through her glad tears, as if she expected to be
      admired for this heroism. And I have no doubt she was.

      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Well, that was another success. The world is round, and like a ball seems
      swinging in the air, and swinging very pleasantly, thought Henderson, as
      he stepped on board the train that evening. The world is truly what you
      make it, and Henderson was determined to make it agreeable. His philosophy
      was concise, and might be hung up, as a motto: Get all you can, and don&rsquo;t
      fret about what you cannot get.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the smoking compartment, and sat musing by the window for
      some time before he lit his cigar, feeling a glow of happiness that was
      new in his experience. The country was charming at twilight, but he was
      little conscious of that. What he saw distinctly was Margaret&rsquo;s face,
      trustful and wistful, looking up into his as she bade him goodby. What he
      was vividly conscious of was being followed, enveloped, by a woman&rsquo;s love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will write, dear, the moment you get there, will you not? I am so
      afraid of accidents,&rdquo; she had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I will telegraph, sweet,&rdquo; he had replied, quite gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you? Telegraph? I never had that sort of a message.&rdquo; It seemed a
      very wonderful thing that he should use the public wire for this purpose,
      and she looked at him with new admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you timid about the train?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I never think of it. I never thought of it for myself; but this is
      different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo; He put his arm round her and looked down into her eyes. This
      was a humorous suggestion to him, who spent half his time on the trains.
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take out an accident policy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. But you men are so reckless. Promise you won&rsquo;t stand on
      the platform, and won&rsquo;t get off while the train is in motion, and all the
      rest of the directions,&rdquo; she said, laughing a little with him; &ldquo;and you
      will be careful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take such care of myself as I never did before, I promise. I never
      felt of so much consequence in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think me silly. But you know, don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rdquo; She put a hand on
      each shoulder, and pushing him back, studied his face. &ldquo;You are all the
      world. And only to think, day before yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t think of the
      trains at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To have one look like that from a woman! To carry it with him! Henderson
      still forgot to light his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Rodney!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Hollowell! I thought you were in Kansas City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer was a man of middle age, thick set, with rounded shoulders,
      deep chest, heavy neck, iron-gray hair close cut, gray whiskers cropped so
      as to show his strong jaw, blue eyes that expressed at once resolution and
      good-nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;s things? Been up to fix the Legislature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Perkins is attending to that,&rdquo; said Henderson, rather indifferently,
      like a man awakened out of a pleasant dream. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to need much
      fixing. The public are fond of parallels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hollowell laughed. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s so&mdash;till they get &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or don&rsquo;t get them,&rdquo; Henderson added. And then both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks as if it would go through this time. Bemis says the C. D.&lsquo;s
      badly scared. They&rsquo;ll have to come down lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. By-the-way, look in tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve got something to
      show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson lit his cigar, and they both puffed in silence for some moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By-the-way, did I ever show you this?&rdquo; Hollowell took from his
      breast-pocket a handsome morocco case, and handed it to his companion. &ldquo;I
      never travel without that. It&rsquo;s better than an accident policy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson unfolded the case, and saw seven photographs&mdash;a
      showy-looking handsome woman in lace and jewels, and six children,
      handsome like their mother, the whole group with the photographic look of
      prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson looked at it as if it had been a mirror of his own destiny, and
      expressed his admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s hard to beat,&rdquo; Hollowell confessed, with a soft look in his
      face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for sale. Seven figures wouldn&rsquo;t touch it.&rdquo; He looked at
      it lovingly before he put it up, and then added: &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a figure
      for each, Rodney, and a big nest-egg for the old woman besides. There&rsquo;s
      nothing like it, old man. You&rsquo;d better come in.&rdquo; And he put his hand
      affectionately on Henderson&rsquo;s knee.

    <p>
      Jeremiah Hollowell&mdash;commonly known as Jerry&mdash;was a remarkable
      man. Thirty years ago he had come to the city from Maine as a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; on a
      coast schooner, obtained employment in a railroad yard, then as a freight
      conductor, gone West, become a contractor, in which position a lucky hit
      set him on the road of the unscrupulous accumulation of property. He was
      now a railway magnate, the president of a system, a manipulator of
      dexterity and courage. All this would not have come about if his big head
      had not been packed with common-sense brains, and he had not had uncommon
      will and force of character. Success had developed the best side of him,
      the family side; and the worst side of him&mdash;a brutal determination to
      increase his big fortune. He was not hampered by any scruples in business,
      but he had the good-sense to deal squarely with his friends when he had
      distinctly agreed to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson did not respond to the matrimonial suggestion; it was not
      possible for him to vulgarize his own affair by hinting it to such a man
      as Hollowell; but they soon fell into serious talk about schemes in which
      they were both interested. This talk so absorbed Henderson that after they
      had reached the city he had walked some blocks towards his lodging before
      he recalled his promise about the message. On his table he found a note
      from Carmen bidding him to dinner informally&mdash;an invitation which he
      had no difficulty in declining on account of a previous engagement. And
      then he went to his club, and passed a cheerful evening. Why not? There
      was nothing melancholy about the young fellows in the smoking-room, who
      liked a good story and the latest gossip, and were attracted to the
      society of Henderson, who was open-handed and full of animal spirits, and
      above all had a reputation for success, and for being on the inside of
      affairs. There is nowhere else so much wisdom and such understanding of
      life as in a city club of young fellows, who have their experience still,
      for the most part, before them. Henderson was that night in great &ldquo;force&rdquo;&mdash;as
      the phrase is. His companions thought he had made a lucky turn, and he did
      not tell them that he had won the love of the finest girl in the world,
      who was at that moment thinking of him as fondly as he was thinking of her&mdash;but
      this was the subconsciousness of his gayety. Late at night he wrote her a
      long letter&mdash;an honest letter of love and admiration, which warmed
      into the tenderness of devotion as it went on; a letter that she never
      parted with all her life long; but he left a description of the loneliness
      of his evening without her to her imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for Margaret also a happy evening, but not a calm one, and not gay.
      She was swept away by a flood of emotions. She wanted to be alone, to
      think it over, every item of the short visit, every look, every tone. Was
      it all true? The great change made her tremble: of the future she dared
      scarcely think. She was restless, but not restless as before; she could
      not be calm in such a great happiness. And then the wonder of it, that he
      should choose her of all others&mdash;he who knew the world so well, and
      must have known so many women. She followed him on his journey, thinking
      what he was doing now, and now, and now. She would have given the world to
      see him just for a moment, to look in his eyes and be sure again, to have
      him say that little word once more: there was a kind of pain in her heart,
      the separation was so cruel; it had been over two hours now. More than
      once in the evening she ran down to the sitting-room, where her aunt was
      pretending to be absorbed in a book, to kiss her, to pet her, to smooth
      her grayish hair and pat her cheek, and get her to talk about her girlhood
      days. She was so happy that tears were in her eyes half the time. At nine
      o&rsquo;clock there was a pull at the bell that threatened to drag the wire out,
      and an insignificant little urchin appeared with a telegram, which
      frightened Miss Forsythe, and seemed to Margaret to drop out of heaven.
      Such an absurd thing to do at night, said the aunt, and then she kissed
      Margaret, and laughed a little, and declared that things had come to a
      queer pass when people made love by telegraph. There wasn&rsquo;t any love in
      the telegram, Margaret said; but she knew better&mdash;the sending word of
      his arrival was a marvelous exhibition of thoughtfulness and constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she led her aunt on to talk of Mr. Henderson, to give her
      impression, how he looked, what she really thought of him, and so on, and
      so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much to say, but it could be said over and over again in
      various ways. It was the one night of the world, and her overwrought
      feeling sought relief. It would not be so again. She would be more
      reticent and more coquettish about her lover, but now it was all so new
      and strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night when the girl went to sleep the telegram was under her pillow,
      and it seemed to throb with a thousand messages, as if it felt the
      pulsation of the current that sent it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospective marriage of the budding millionaire Rodney Henderson was a
      society paper item in less than a week&mdash;the modern method of
      publishing the banns. This was accompanied by a patronizing reference to
      the pretty school-ma&rsquo;am, who was complimented upon her good-fortune in
      phrases so neatly turned as to give Henderson the greatest offense, and
      leave him no remedy, since nothing could have better suited the journal
      than further notoriety. He could not remember that he had spoken of it to
      any one except the Eschelles, to whom his relations made the communication
      a necessity, and he suspected Carmen, without, however, guessing that she
      was a habitual purveyor of the town gossiper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shameful impertinence,&rdquo; she burst out, introducing the subject
      herself, when he called to see her. &ldquo;I would horsewhip the editor.&rdquo; Her
      indignation was so genuine, and she took his side with such warm good
      comradeship, that his suspicions vanished for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good?&rdquo; he answered, cooling down at the sight of her rage. &ldquo;It is
      true, we are to be married, and she has taught school. I can&rsquo;t drag her
      name into a row about it. Perhaps she never will see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! dear me! what have I done?&rdquo; the girl cried, with an accent of
      contrition. &ldquo;I never thought of that. I was so angry that I cut it out and
      put it in the letter that was to contain nothing but congratulations, and
      told her how perfectly outrageous I thought it. How stupid!&rdquo; and there was
      a world of trouble in her big dark eyes, while she looked up penitently,
      as if to ask his forgiveness for a great crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it cannot be helped,&rdquo; Henderson said, with a little touch of
      sympathy for Carmen&rsquo;s grief. &ldquo;Those who know her will think it simply
      malicious, and the others will not think of it a second time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot forgive myself for my stupidity. I&rsquo;m not sure but I&rsquo;d rather
      you&rsquo;d think me wicked than stupid,&rdquo; she continued, with the smile in her
      eyes that most men found attractive. &ldquo;I confess&mdash;is that very bad?&mdash;that
      I feel it more for you than for her. But&rdquo; ( she thought she saw a shade in
      his face) &ldquo;I warn you, if you are not very nice, I shall transfer my
      affections to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was in her best mood, with the manner of a confiding, intimate
      friend. She talked about Margaret, but not too much, and a good deal more
      about Henderson and his future, not laying too great stress upon the
      marriage, as if it were, in fact, only an incident in his career,
      contriving always to make herself appear as a friend, who hadn&rsquo;t many
      illusions or much romance, to be sure, but who could always be relied on
      in any mood or any perplexity, and wouldn&rsquo;t be frightened or very severe
      at any confidences. She posed as a woman who could make allowances, and
      whose friendship would be no check or hinderance. This was conveyed in
      manner as much as in words, and put Henderson quite at his ease. He was
      not above the weakness of liking the comradeship of a woman of whom he was
      not afraid, a woman to whom he could say anything, a woman who could make
      allowances. Perhaps he was hardly conscious of this. He knew Carmen better
      than she thought he knew her, and he couldn&rsquo;t approve of her as a wife;
      and yet the fact was that she never gave him any moral worries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, when the talk drifted that way, &ldquo;the chrysalis earl has
      gone. I think that mamma is quite inconsolable. She says she doesn&rsquo;t
      understand girls, or men, or anything, these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; asked Henderson, lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? No. I&rsquo;m an agnostic&mdash;except in religion. Have you got it into
      your head, my friend, that I ever fancied Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for himself&mdash;&rdquo; began Henderson, mischievously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do.&rdquo; She stopped him. &ldquo;Or that he ever had any intention&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he could resist such&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff! See here, Mr. Rodney!&rdquo; The girl sprang up, seized a plaque from
      the table, held it aloft in one hand, took half a dozen fascinating,
      languid steps, advancing and retreating with the grace of a Nautch girl,
      holding her dress with the other hand so as to allow a free movement. &ldquo;Do
      you think I&rsquo;d ever do that for John the Lyon&rsquo;s head on a charger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her mood changed to the domestic, as she threw herself into an
      easy-chair and said: &ldquo;After all, I&rsquo;m rather sorry he has gone. He was a
      man you could trust; that is, if you wanted to trust anybody&mdash;I wish
      I had been made good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Henderson bade her good-night it was with the renewed impression that
      she was a very diverting comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sort of sorry for you,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes were not so serious as
      to offend, as she gave him her hand, &ldquo;for when you are married, you know,
      as the saying is, you&rsquo;ll want some place to spend your evenings.&rdquo; The
      audacity of the remark was quite obscured in the innocent frankness and
      sweetness of her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Henderson had to show Hollowell in his office had been of a nature
      greatly to interest that able financier. It was a project that would have
      excited the sympathy of Carmen, but Henderson did not speak of it to her&mdash;though
      he had found that she was a safe deposit of daring schemes in general&mdash;on
      account of a feeling of loyalty to Margaret, to whom he had never
      mentioned it in any of his daily letters. The scheme made a great deal of
      noise, later on, when it came to the light of consummation in legislatures
      and in courts, both civil and criminal; but its magnitude and success
      added greatly to Henderson&rsquo;s reputation as a bold and fortunate operator,
      and gave him that consideration which always attaches to those who command
      millions of money, and have the nerve to go undaunted through the most
      trying crises. I am anticipating by saying that it absolutely ruined
      thousands of innocent people, caused widespread strikes and practical
      business paralysis over a large region; but those things were regarded as
      only incidental to a certain sort of development, and did not impair the
      business standing, and rather helped the social position, of the two or
      three men who counted their gains by millions in the operation. It
      furnished occupation and gave good fees to a multitude of lawyers, and was
      dignified by the anxious consultation of many learned judges. A moralist,
      if he were poor and pessimistic, might have put the case in a line, and
      taken that line from the Mosaic decalogue (which was not intended for this
      new dispensation); but it was involved in such a cloud of legal
      technicalities, and took on such an aspect of enterprise and development
      of resources, and what not, that the general public mind was completely
      befogged about it. I am charitable enough to suppose that if the scheme
      had failed, the public conscience is so tender that there would have been
      a question of Henderson&rsquo;s honesty. But it did not fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this scheme, however, we knew nothing at the time in Brandon. Henderson
      was never in better spirits, never more agreeable, and it did not need
      inquiry to convince one that he was never so prosperous. He was often with
      us, in flying visits, and I can well remember that his coming and the
      expectation of it gave a kind of elation to the summer&mdash;that and
      Margaret&rsquo;s supreme and sunny happiness. Even my wife admitted that it was
      on both sides a love-match, and could urge nothing against it except the
      woman&rsquo;s instinct that made her shrink from the point of ever thinking of
      him as a husband for herself, which seemed to me a perfectly reasonable
      feeling under all the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer&mdash;or what we call summer in the North, which is usually a
      preparation for warm weather, ending in a preparation for cold weather&mdash;seemed
      to me very short&mdash;but I have noticed that each summer is a little
      shorter than the preceding one. If Henderson had wanted to gain the
      confidence of my wife he could not have done so more effectually than he
      did in making us the confidants of a little plan he had in the city, which
      was a profound secret to the party most concerned. This was the purchase
      and furnishing of a house, and we made many clandestine visits with him to
      town in the early autumn in furtherance of his plan. He was intent on a
      little surprise, and when I once hinted to him that women liked to have a
      hand in making the home they were to occupy, he said he thought that my
      wife knew Margaret&rsquo;s taste&mdash;and besides, he added, with a smile, &ldquo;it
      will be only temporary; I should like her, if she chooses, to build and
      furnish a house to suit herself.&rdquo; In any one else this would have seemed
      like assumption, but with Henderson it was only the simple belief in his
      career.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were still more surprised when we came to see the temporary home that
      Henderson had selected, the place where the bride was to alight, and look
      about her for such a home as would suit her growing idea of expanding
      fortune and position. It was one of the old-fashioned mansions on
      Washington Square, built at a time when people attached more importance to
      room and comfort than to outside display&mdash;a house that seemed to have
      traditions of hospitality and of serene family life. It was being
      thoroughly renovated and furnished, with as little help from the
      decorative artist and the splendid upholsterer as consisted with some
      regard to public opinion; in fact the expenditure showed in solid dignity
      and luxurious ease, and not in the construction of a museum in which one
      could only move about with the constant fear of destroying something. My
      wife was given almost carte blanche in the indulgence of her taste, and
      she confessed her delight in being able for once to deal with a house
      without the feeling that she was ruining me. Only in the suite designed
      for Margaret did Henderson seriously interfere, and insist upon a luxury
      that almost took my wife&rsquo;s breath away. She opposed it on moral grounds.
      She said that no true woman could stand such pampering of her senses
      without destruction of her moral fibre. But Henderson had his way, as he
      always had it. What pleased her most in the house was the conservatory,
      opening out from the drawing-room&mdash;a spacious place with a fountain
      and cool vines and flowering plants, not a tropical hothouse in a stifling
      atmosphere, in which nothing could live except orchids and flowers born
      near the equator, but a garden with a temperature adapted to human lungs,
      where one could sit and enjoy the sunshine, and the odor of flowers, and
      the clear and not too incessant notes of Mexican birds. But when it was
      all done, undoubtedly the most agreeable room in the house was that to
      which least thought had been given, the room to which any odds and ends
      could be sent, the room to which everybody gravitated when rest and simple
      enjoyment without restraint were the object Henderson&rsquo;s own library, with
      its big open fire, and the books and belongings of his bachelor days. Man
      is usually not credited with much taste or ability to take care of himself
      in the matter of comfortable living, but it is frequently noticed that
      when woman has made a dainty paradise of every other portion of the house,
      the room she most enjoys, that from which it is difficult to keep out the
      family, is the one that the man is permitted to call his own, in which he
      retains some of the comforts and can indulge some of the habits of his
      bachelor days. There is an important truth in this fact with regard to the
      sexes, but I do not know what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married in October, and went at once to their own house. I
      suppose all other days were but a preparation for this golden autumn day
      on which we went to church and returned to the wedding-breakfast. I am
      sure everybody was happy. Miss Forsythe was so happy that tears were in
      her eyes half the time, and she bustled about with an affectation of
      cheerfulness that was almost contagious. Poor, dear, gentle lady! I can
      imagine the sensations of a peach-tree, in an orchard of trees which bud
      and bloom and by-and-by are weighty with yellow fruit, year after year&mdash;a
      peach-tree that blooms, also, but never comes to fruition, only wastes its
      delicate sweetness on the air, and finally blooms less and less, but feels
      nevertheless in each returning spring the stir of the sap and the longing
      for that fuller life, while all the orchard bursts into flower, and the
      bees swarm about the pink promises, and the fruit sets and slowly matures
      to lusciousness in the sun of July. I fancy the wedding, which robbed us
      all, was hardest for her, for it was in one sense a finality of her life.
      Whereas if Margaret had regrets&mdash;and deep sorrow she had in wrenching
      herself from the little neighborhood, though she never could have guessed
      the vacancy she caused by the withdrawal of her loved presence&mdash;her
      own life was only just beginning, and she was sustained by the longing
      which every human soul has for a new career, by the curiosity and
      imagination which the traveler feels when he departs for a land which he
      desires, and yet dreads to see lest his illusions should vanish. Margaret
      was about to take that journey in the world which Miss Forsythe had
      dreamed of in her youth, but had never set out on. There are some who say
      that those are happiest who keep at home and content themselves with
      reading about the lands of the imagination. But happily the world does not
      believe this, and indeed would be very unhappy if it could not try and
      prove all the possibilities of human nature, to suffer as well as to
      enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know how we fell into the feeling that this marriage was somehow
      exceptional and important, since marriages take place every day, and are
      so common and ordinarily so commonplace, when the first flutter is over.
      Even Morgan said, in his wife&rsquo;s presence, that he thought there had been
      weddings enough; at least he would interdict those that upset things like
      this one. For one thing, it brought about the house-keeping union of Mrs.
      Fletcher and Miss Forsythe in the tatter&rsquo;s cottage&mdash;a sort of closing
      up of the ranks that happens on the field during a fatal engagement. As we
      go on, it becomes more and more difficult to fill up the gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were very unwilling to feel that Margaret had gone out of our life.
      &ldquo;But you cannot,&rdquo; Morgan used to say, &ldquo;be friends with the rich, and that
      is what makes the position of the very rich so pitiful, for the rich get
      so tired of each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Margaret,&rdquo; my wife urged, &ldquo;will never be of that sort: money will not
      change either her habits or her affections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. You can never trust to inherited poverty. I have no doubt that
      she will resist the world, if anybody can, but my advice is that if you
      want to keep along with Margaret, you&rsquo;d better urge your husband to make
      money. Experience seems to teach that while they cannot come to us, we may
      sometimes go to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife and Mrs. Fletcher were both indignant at this banter, and accused
      Morgan of want of faith, and even lack of affection for Margaret; in
      short, of worldly-mindedness himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am rather shop-worn,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not distrust of
      Margaret&rsquo;s intentions, but knowledge of the strength of the current on
      which she has embarked. Henderson will not stop in his career short of
      some overwhelming disaster or of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you liked him? At any rate, Margaret will make a good use of
      his money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a question, my dear Mrs. Fairchild, of the use of money, but of
      the use money makes of you. Yes, I do like Henderson, but I can&rsquo;t give up
      my philosophy of life for the sake of one good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philosophy of fudge!&rdquo; exclaimed my wife. And there really was no answer
      to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      After six weeks had passed, my wife paid a visit to Margaret. Nothing
      could exceed the affectionate cordiality of her welcome. Margaret was
      overjoyed to see her, to show the house, to have her know her husband
      better, to take her into her new life. She was hardly yet over the naive
      surprises of her lovely surroundings. Or if it is too mach to say that her
      surprise had lasted six weeks&mdash;for it is marvelous how soon women
      adapt themselves to new conditions if they are agreeable&mdash;she was in
      a glow of wonder at her husband&rsquo;s goodness, at his love, which had
      procured all this happiness for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no idea,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how thoughtful he is about everything&mdash;and
      he makes so little of it all. I am to thank you, he tells me always, for
      whatever pleases my taste in the house, and indeed I think I should have
      known you had been here if he had not told me. There are so many little
      touches that remind me of home. I am glad of that, for it is the more
      likely to make you feel that it is your home also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clung to this idea in the whirl of the new life. In the first days she
      dwelt much on this theme; indeed it was hardly second in her talk to her
      worship&mdash;I can call it nothing less&mdash;of her husband. She liked
      to talk of Brandon and the dear life there and the dearer friends&mdash;this
      much talk about it showed that it was another life, already of the past,
      and beginning to be distant in the mind. My wife had a feeling that
      Margaret, thus early, was conscious of a drift, of a widening space, and
      was making an effort to pull the two parts of her life together, that
      there should be no break, as one carried away to sea by a resistless tide
      grasps the straining rope that still maintains his slender connection with
      the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was all so different: the luxurious house, the carriage at call,
      the box at the opera, the social duties inevitable with her own
      acquaintances and the friends of her husband. She spoke of this in moments
      of confidence, and when she was tired, with a consciousness that it was a
      different life, but in no tone of regret, and I fancy that the French
      blood in her veins, which had so long run decorously in Puritan channels,
      leaped at its return into new gayety. Years ago Margaret had thought that
      she might some time be a missionary, at least that she should like to
      devote her life to useful labors among the poor and the unfortunate. If
      conscience ever reminded her of this, conscience was quieted by the
      suggestion that now she was in a position to be more liberal than she ever
      expected to be; that is, to give everything except the essential thing&mdash;herself.
      Henderson liked a gay house, brightness, dinners, entertainment, and that
      his wife should be seen and admired. Proof of his love she found in all
      this, and she entered into it with spirit, and an enjoyment increased by
      the thought that she was lightening the burden of his business, which she
      could see pressed more and more. Not that Henderson made any account of
      his growing occupations, or that any preoccupation was visible except to
      the eye of love, which is quick to see all moods. These were indeed happy
      days, full of the brightness of an expanding prosperity and unlimited
      possibilities of the enjoyment of life. It was in obedience to her natural
      instinct, and not yet a feeling of compensation and propitiation, that
      enlisted Margaret in the city charities, connection with which was a
      fashionable self-entertainment with some, and a means of social promotion
      with others. My wife came home a little weary with so much of the world,
      but, on the whole, impressed with Margaret&rsquo;s good-fortune. Henderson in
      his own house was the soul of consideration and hospitality, and Margaret
      was blooming in the beauty that shines in satisfied desire.

    <p>
      It is so painful to shrink, and so delightful to grow! Every one knows the
      renovation of feeling&mdash;often mistaken for a moral renewal&mdash;when
      the worn dress of the day is exchanged for the fresh evening toilet. The
      expansiveness of prosperity has a like effect, though the moralist is
      always piping about the beneficent uses of adversity. The moralist is, of
      course, right, time enough given; but what does the tree, putting out its
      tender green leaves to the wooing of the south wind, care for the
      moralist? How charming the world is when you go with it, and not against
      it!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was better than Margaret had thought. When she came to Washington in
      the winter season the beautiful city seemed to welcome her and respond to
      the gayety of her spirit. It was so open, cheerful, hospitable, in the
      appearance of its smooth, broad avenues and pretty little parks, with the
      bronze statues which all looked noble&mdash;in the moonlight; it was such
      a combination and piquant contrast of shabby ease and stately elegance&mdash;negro
      cabins and stone mansions, picket-fences and sheds, and flower-banked
      terraces before rows of residences which bespoke wealth and refinement.
      The very aspect of the street population was novel; compared to New York,
      the city was as silent as a country village, and the passers, who have the
      fashion of walking in the middle of the street upon the asphalt as freely
      as upon the sidewalks, had a sort of busy leisureliness, the natural air
      of thousands of officials hived in offices for a few hours and then left
      in irresponsible idleness. But what most distinguished the town, after
      all, in Margaret&rsquo;s first glimpse of it, was the swarming negro population
      pervading every part of it&mdash;the slouching plantation negro, the smart
      mulatto girl with gay raiment and mincing step, the old-time auntie, the
      brisk waiter-boy with uncertain eye, the washerwoman, the hawkers and
      fruiterers, the loafing strollers of both sexes&mdash;carrying everywhere
      color, abandon, a certain picturesqueness and irresponsibility and
      good-nature, and a sense of moral relaxation in a too strict and
      duty-ridden world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, when Margaret looked from the windows of the hotel, the
      sky was gray and yielding, and all the outlines of the looming buildings
      were softened in the hazy air. The dome of the Capitol seemed to float
      like a bubble, and to be as unsubstantial as the genii edifices in the
      Arabian tale. The Monument, the slim white shaft as tall as the Great
      Pyramid, was still more a dream creation, not really made of hard marble,
      but of something as soft as vapor, almost melting into the sky, and yet
      distinct, unwavering, its point piercing the upper air, threatening every
      instant to dissolve, as if it were truly the baseless fabric of a vision&mdash;light,
      unreal, ghost-like, spotless, pure as an unsullied thought; it might
      vanish in a breath; and yet, no; it is solid: in the mist of doubt, in the
      assault of storms, smitten by the sun, beaten by the tempests, it stands
      there, springing, graceful, immovable&mdash;emblem, let us say, of the
      purity and permanence of the republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never half told me, Rodney, how beautiful it all is!&rdquo; Margaret
      exclaimed, in a glow of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Henderson, &ldquo;the Monument is behaving very well this morning. I
      never saw it before look so little like a factory chimney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, you never looked at it with my eyes before, cynic. But it is all
      so lovely, everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is, dear.&rdquo; They were standing together at the window, and
      his arm was where it should have been. &ldquo;What did you expect? There are
      concentrated here the taste and virtue of sixty millions of people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you always said the Washington hotels were so bad. These apartments
      are charming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;and he drew her closer to him&mdash;&ldquo;there is no denying that.
      But presently I shall have to explain to you an odd phenomenon. Virginia,
      you know, used to be famous for its good living, and Maryland was simply
      unapproachable for good cooking. It was expected when the District was
      made out of these two that the result would be something quite
      extraordinary in the places of public entertainment. But, by a process
      which nobody can explain, in the union the art of cooking in hotels got
      mislaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, with winning illogicality, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could only eat the breakfasts for me, as you can see the Monument
      for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, I could eat the Monument for you, if it would do you any good.&rdquo; And
      neither of them was ashamed of this nonsense, for both knew that married
      people indulge in it when they are happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Henderson came to Washington on business, this was Margaret&rsquo;s
      wedding journey. There is no other city in the world where a wedding
      journey can better be combined with such business as is transacted here,
      for in both is a certain element of mystery. Washington is gracious to a
      bride, if she is pretty and agreeable&mdash;devotion to governing, or to
      legislation, or to diplomacy, does not render a man insensible to feminine
      attractions; and if in addition to beauty a woman has the reputation of
      wealth, she is as nearly irresistible here as anywhere. To Margaret, who
      was able to return the hospitality she received, and whose equipage was
      almost as much admired as her toilets, all doors were open&mdash;a very
      natural thing, surely, in a good-natured, give-and-take world. The colonel&mdash;Margaret
      had laughed till she cried when first she heard her husband saluted by
      this title in Washington by his New Hampshire acquaintances, but he
      explained to her that he had justly won it years ago by undergoing the
      hardship of receptions as a member of the Governor&rsquo;s staff&mdash;the
      colonel had brought on his horses and carriages, not at all by way of
      ostentation, but simply out of regard to what was due her as his wife, and
      because a carriage at call is a constant necessity in this city, whose
      dignity is equal to the square of its distances, and because there is
      something incongruous in sending a bride about in a herdic. Margaret&rsquo;s
      unworldly simplicity had received a little shock when she first saw her
      servants in livery, but she was not slow to see the propriety and even
      necessity of it in a republican society, since elegance cannot be a
      patchwork, but must be harmonious, and there is no harmony between a
      stylish turnout&mdash;noble horses nobly caparisoned&mdash;and a coachman
      and footman on the box dressed according to their own vulgar taste. Given
      a certain position, one&rsquo;s sense of fitness and taste mast be maintained.
      And there is so much kindliness and consideration in human nature&mdash;Margaret&rsquo;s
      gorgeous coachman and footman never by a look revealed their knowledge
      that she was new to the situation, and I dare say that their respectful
      demeanor contributed to raise her in her own esteem as one of the select
      and favored in this prosperous world. The most self-poised and genuine are
      not insensible to the tribute of this personal consideration. My lady
      giving orders to her respectful servitors, and driving down the avenue in
      her luxurious turnout, is not at all the same person in feeling that she
      would be if dragged about in a dissolute-looking hack whose driver has the
      air of the stable. We take kindly to this transformation, and perhaps it
      is only the vulgar in soul who become snobbish in it. Little by little,
      under this genial consideration, Margaret advanced in the pleasant path of
      worldliness; and we heard, by the newspapers and otherwise&mdash;indeed,
      Mr. and Mrs. Morgan were there for a couple of weeks in the winter&mdash;that
      she was never more sweet and gracious and lovely than in this first season
      at the capital. I don&rsquo;t know that the town was raving, as they said, about
      her beauty and wit&mdash;there is nothing like the wit of a handsome woman&mdash;and
      amiability and unostentatious little charities, but she was a great
      favorite. We used to talk about it by the fire in Brandon, where
      everything reminded us of the girl we loved, and rejoice in her
      good-fortune and happiness, and get rather heavy-hearted in thinking that
      she had gone away from us into such splendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were here,&rdquo; she wrote to my wife. &ldquo;I am sure you would enjoy
      it. There are so many distinguished people and brilliant people&mdash;though
      the distinguished are not always brilliant nor the brilliant distinguished&mdash;and
      everybody is so kind and hospitable, and Rodney is such a favorite. We go
      everywhere, literally, and all the time. You must not scold, but I haven&rsquo;t
      opened a book, except my prayerbook, in six weeks&mdash;it is such a
      whirl. And it is so amusing. I didn&rsquo;t know there were so many kinds of
      people and so many sorts of provincialism in the world. The other night,
      at the British Minister&rsquo;s, a French attache, who complimented my awful
      French&mdash;I told him that I inherited all but the vocabulary and the
      accent&mdash;said that if specimens of the different kinds of women
      evolved in all out-of-the-way places who come to Washington could be
      exhibited, nobody would doubt any more that America is an interesting
      country. Wasn&rsquo;t it an impudent speech? I tried to tell him, in French, how
      grateful American women are for any little attention from foreigners who
      have centuries of politeness behind them. Ah me! I sometimes long for one
      of the old-fashioned talks before your smoldering logs! What we talk about
      here, Heaven only knows. I sometimes tell Rodney at night&mdash;it is
      usually morning&mdash;that I feel like an extinct piece of fireworks. But
      next day it is all delightful again; and, dear friend, I don&rsquo;t know but
      that I like being fireworks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Among the men who came oftenest to see Henderson was Jerry Hollowell. It
      seemed to Margaret an odd sort of companionship; it could not be any
      similarity of tastes that drew them together, and she could not understand
      the nature of the business transacted in their mysterious conferences.
      Social life had few attractions for Hollowell, for his family were in the
      West; he appeared to have no relations with any branch of government; he
      wanted no office, though his influence was much sought by those who did
      want it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spend a good deal of time here, Mr. Hollowell,&rdquo; Margaret said one day
      when he called in Henderson&rsquo;s absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, considerable. Things need a good deal of fixing up.
      Washington is a curious place. It&rsquo;s a sort of exchange for the whole
      country: you can see everybody here, and it is a good place to arrange
      matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Congress, do you mean?&rdquo; Margaret had heard much of the corruption of
      Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not Congress particularly. Congressmen are just about like other
      people. It&rsquo;s all nonsense, this talk about buying Congressmen. You cannot
      buy them any more than you can buy other people, but you can sort of work
      together with some of them. We don&rsquo;t want anything of Congress, except to
      be let alone. If we are doing something to develop the trade in the
      Southwest, build it up, some member who thinks he is smart will just as
      likely as not try to put in a block somewhere, or investigate, or
      something, in order to show his independence, and then he has to be seen,
      and shown that he is going against the interests of his constituents. It
      is just as it is everywhere: men have to be shown what their real interest
      is. No; most Congressmen are poor, and they stay poor. It is a good deal
      easier to deal with those among them who are rich and have some idea about
      the prosperity of the country. It is just so in the departments. You&rsquo;ve
      got to watch things, if you expect them to go smooth. You&rsquo;ve got to get
      acquainted with the men. Most men are reasonable when you get well
      acquainted with them. I tell your husband that people are about as
      reasonable in Washington as you&rsquo;ll find them anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington is certainly very pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so; it is pleasant. Where most everybody wants something,
      they are bound to be accommodating. That&rsquo;s my idea. I reckon you don&rsquo;t
      find Jerry Hollowell trying to pull a cat by its tail,&rdquo; he added, dropping
      into his native manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must go and hunt up the old man. Glad to have made your
      acquaintance, Mrs. Henderson.&rdquo; And then, with a sly look, &ldquo;If I knew you
      better, ma&rsquo;am, I should take the liberty of congratulating you that
      Henderson has come round so handsomely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come round?&rdquo; asked Margaret, in amused wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I took the liberty of giving him a hint that he wasn&rsquo;t cut-out for
      a single man. I showed him that,&rdquo; and he lugged out his photograph-case
      from a mass of papers in his breast-pocket and handed it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; said Margaret, studying the photographs with a peculiar
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Henderson knows a good thing when he sees it,&rdquo; said Hollowell,
      complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy to be offended with Hollowell&rsquo;s kind-hearted boorishness,
      and after he had gone, Margaret sat a long time reflecting upon this new
      specimen of man in her experience. She was getting many new ideas in these
      days, the moral lines were not as clearly drawn as she had thought; it was
      impossible to ticket men off into good and bad. In Hollowell she had a
      glimpse of a world low-toned and vulgar; she had heard that he was
      absolutely unscrupulous, and she had supposed that he would appear to be a
      very wicked man. But he seemed to be good-hearted and tolerant and
      friendly. How fond he was of his family, and how charitable about
      Congress! And she wondered if the world was generally on Hollowell&rsquo;s
      level. She met many men more cultivated than he, gentlemen in manner and
      in the first social position, who took, after all, about his tone in
      regard to the world, very agreeable people usually, easy to get on with,
      not exacting, or professing much faith in anybody, and mildly cynical&mdash;only
      bitterly cynical when they failed to get what they wanted, and felt the
      good things of life slipping away from them. It was to take her some time
      to learn that some of the most agreeable people are those who have
      succeeded by the most questionable means; and when she came to this
      knowledge, what would be her power of judgment as to these means?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hollowell has been here,&rdquo; she said, when Henderson returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Jerry? He is a character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you trust him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never occurred to me. Yes, I suppose so, as far as his interests go.
      He isn&rsquo;t a bad sort of fellow&mdash;very long-headed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; said Margaret, with hesitation, &ldquo;I wish you didn&rsquo;t have anything
      to do with such men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. You needn&rsquo;t laugh. It rather lets one down; and it
      isn&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson laughed aloud now. &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t associate with Hollowell. We
      men cannot pick our companions in business and politics. It needs all
      sorts to keep the world going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d rather let it stop,&rdquo; Margaret said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And sell out at auction?&rdquo; he cried, with a look of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t Mr. Morgan and Mr. Fairchild business men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;of the old-fashioned sort. The fact&mdash;is, Margaret, you&rsquo;ve
      got a sort of preserve up in Brandon, and you fancy that the world is
      divided into sheep and goats. It&rsquo;s a great mistake. There is no such
      division. Every man almost is both a sheep and a goat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, Rodney. You are neither.&rdquo; She came close to him, and
      taking the collar of his coat in each hand, gave him a little shake, and
      looking up into his face with quizzical affection, asked, &ldquo;What is your
      business here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson stooped down and kissed her forehead, and tenderly lifted the
      locks of her brown hair. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t understand, sweet, if I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a man here from Fort Worth who wants us to buy a piece of
      railroad, and extend it, and join it with Hollowell&rsquo;s system, and open up
      a lot of new country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it a good piece of road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s the trouble. The owners want to keep it to themselves, and
      prevent the general development. But we shall get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t anything like wrecking, is it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think we would want to wreck our own property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what has Congress to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a land grant. But some of the members who were not in the
      Congress that voted it say that it is forfeited.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this fashion the explanation went on. Margaret loved to hear her
      husband talk, and to watch the changing expression of his face, and he
      explained about this business until she thought he was the sweetest fellow
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Morgans had arrived at the same hotel, and Margaret went about with
      them in the daytime, while Henderson was occupied. It was like a breath of
      home to be with them, and their presence, reviving that old life, gave a
      new zest to the society spectacle, to the innocent round of
      entertainments, which more and more absorbed her. Besides, it was very
      interesting to have Mr. Morgan&rsquo;s point of view of Washington, and to see
      the shifting panorama through his experience. He had been very much in the
      city in former years, but he came less and less now, not because it was
      less beautiful or attractive in a way, but because it had lost for him a
      certain charm it once had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure,&rdquo; he said, as they were driving one day, &ldquo;that it is not
      now the handsomest capital in the world; at any rate, it is on its way to
      be that. No other has public buildings more imposing, or streets and
      avenues so attractive in their interrupted regularity, so many stately
      vistas ending in objects refreshing to the eye&mdash;a bit of park, banks
      of flowers, a statue or a monument that is decorative, at least in the
      distance. As the years go on we shall have finer historical groups,
      triumphal arches and columns that will give it more and more an air of
      distinction, the sort of splendor with which the Roman Empire celebrated
      itself, and, added to this, the libraries and museums and galleries that
      are the chief attractions of European cities. Oh, we have only just begun&mdash;the
      city is so accessible in all directions, and lends itself to all sorts of
      magnificence and beauty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morgan to Margaret, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that he could be
      so eloquent. Page, you ought to be in Congress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to snuff myself out? Congress is not so important a feature as
      it used to be. Washington is getting to have a character of its own; it
      seems as if it wouldn&rsquo;t be much without its official life, yet the process
      is going on here that is so marked all over the country&mdash;the divorce
      of social and political life. I used to think, fifteen years ago, that
      Washington was a standing contradiction to the old aphorism that a
      democracy cannot make society&mdash;there was no more agreeable society in
      the world than that in Washington even ten years ago: society selected
      itself somehow without any marked class distinction, and it was
      delightfully simple and accessible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has changed it?&rdquo; Margaret asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money, which changes everything and everybody. The whole scale has
      altered. There is so much more display and expense. I remember when a
      private carriage in Washington was a rare object. The possession of money
      didn&rsquo;t help one much socially. What made a person desired in any company
      was the talent of being agreeable, talent of some sort, not the ability to
      give a costly dinner or a big ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are more literary and scientific people here, everybody says,&rdquo;
       said Margaret, who was becoming a partisan of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and they keep more to themselves&mdash;withdraw into their studies,
      or hive in their clubs. They tell me that the delightful informality and
      freedom of the old life is gone. Ask the old Washington residents whether
      the coming in of rich people with leisure hasn&rsquo;t demoralized society, or
      stiffened it, and made it impossible after the old sort. It is as easy
      here now as anywhere else to get together a very heavy dinner party&mdash;all
      very grand, but it isn&rsquo;t amusing. It is more and more like New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have been to delightful dinners,&rdquo; Margaret insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. There are still houses of the old sort, where wit and
      good-humor and free hospitality are more conspicuous than expense; but
      when money selects, there is usually an incongruous lot about the board.
      An oracular scientist at the club the other night put it rather neatly
      when he said that a society that exists mainly to pay its debts gets
      stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as clever,&rdquo; Margaret retorted, &ldquo;as the remark of an
      under-secretary at a cabinet reception the other night, that it is one
      thing to entertain and another to be entertaining. I won&rsquo;t have you
      slander Washington. I should like to spend all my winters here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Morgan, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been praising Washington. I should like to
      live here also, if I had the millions of Jerry Hollowell. Jerry is going
      to build a palace out on the Massachusetts Avenue extension bigger than
      the White House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything about Hollowell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is the coming man. He represents the democratic plutocracy that we
      are coming to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Morgan&rsquo;s banter couldn&rsquo;t shake Margaret&rsquo;s enjoyment of the cheerful
      city. &ldquo;You like it as well as anybody,&rdquo; she told him. And in truth he and
      Mrs. Morgan dipped into every gayety that was going. &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;for a couple of weeks. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to be obliged to follow it
      as a steady business. Washington is a good place to take a plunge
      occasionally. And then you can go home and read King Solomon with
      appreciation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret had thought when she came to Washington that she should spend a
      good deal of time at the Capitol, listening to the eloquence of the
      Senators and Representatives, and that she should study the collections
      and the Patent-office and explore all the public buildings, in which she
      had such intense historical interest as a teacher in Brandon. But there
      was little time for these pleasures, which weighed upon her like duties.
      She did go to the Capitol once, and tired herself out tramping up and
      down, and was very proud of it all, and wondered how any legislation was
      ever accomplished, and was confused by the hustling about, the swinging of
      doors, the swarms in the lobbies, and the racing of messengers, and
      concluded unjustly that it was a big hive of whispered conference, and
      bargaining, and private interviewing. Morgan asked her if she expected
      that the business of sixty millions of people was going to be done with
      the order and decorum of a lyceum debating society. In one of the
      committee-rooms she saw Hollowell, looking at ease, and apparently an
      indispensable part of the government machine. Her own husband, who had
      accompanied the party, she lost presently, whisked away somewhere. He was
      sought in vain afterwards, and at last Margaret came away dazed and
      stunned by the noise of the wheels of the great republic in motion. She
      did not try it again, and very little strolling about the departments
      satisfied her. The west end claimed her&mdash;the rolling equipages, the
      drawing-rooms, the dress, the vistas of evening lamps, the gay chatter in
      a hundred shining houses, the exquisite dinners, the crush of the
      assemblies, the full flow of the tide of fashion and of enjoyment&mdash;what
      is there so good in life? To be young, to be rich, to be pretty, to be
      loved, to be admired, to compliment and be complimented&mdash;every Sunday
      at morning service, kneeling in a fluttering row of the sweetly devout,
      whose fresh toilets made it good to be there, and who might humbly hope to
      be forgiven for the things they have left undone, Margaret thanked Heaven
      for its gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it went well with Henderson meantime. Surely he was born under a lucky
      star&mdash;if it is good-luck for a man to have absolute prosperity and
      the gratification of all his desires. One reason why Hollowell sought his
      cooperation was a belief in this luck, and besides Henderson was, he knew,
      more presentable, and had social access in quarters where influence was
      desirable, although Hollowell was discovering that with most men delicacy
      in presenting anything that is for their interest is thrown away. He found
      no difficulty in getting recruits for his little dinners at Champolion&rsquo;s&mdash;dinners
      that were not always given in his name, and where he appeared as a guest,
      though he footed the bills. Bungling grossness has disappeared from all
      really able and large transactions, and genius is mainly exercised in the
      supply of motives for a line of conduct. The public good is one of the
      motives that looks best in Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson and Hollowell got what they wanted in regard to the Southwest
      consolidation, and got it in the most gentlemanly way. Nobody was bought,
      no one was offered a bribe. There were, of course, fees paid for opinions
      and for professional services, and some able men induced to take a
      prospective interest in what was demonstrably for the public good. But no
      vote was given for a consideration&mdash;at least this was the report of
      an investigating committee later on. Nothing, of course, goes through
      Congress of its own weight, except occasionally a resolution of sympathy
      with the Coreans, and the calendar needs to be watched, and the good
      offices of friends secured. Skillful wording of a clause, the right
      moment, and opportune recognition do the business. The main thing is to
      create a favorable atmosphere and avoid discussion. When the bill was
      passed, Hollowell did give a dinner on his own invitation, a dinner that
      was talked of for its refinement as well as its cost. The chief topic of
      conversation was the development of the Southwest and the extension of our
      trade relations with Mexico. The little scheme, hatched in Henderson&rsquo;s New
      York office, in order to transfer certain already created values to the
      pockets of himself and his friends, appeared to have a national
      importance. When Henderson rose to propose the health of Jerry Hollowell,
      neither he nor the man he eulogized as a creator of industries whose
      republican patriotism was not bound by State lines nor circumscribed by
      sections was without a sense of the humor of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet in a certain way Mr. Hollowell was conscious that he merited the
      eulogy. He had come to believe that the enterprises in which he was
      engaged, that absolutely gave him, it was believed, an income of a million
      a year, were for the public good. Such vast operations lent him the
      importance of a public man. If he was a victim of the confusion of mind
      which mistook his own prosperity for the general benefit, he only shared a
      wide public opinion which regards the accumulation of enormous fortunes in
      a few hands as an evidence of national wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret left Washington with regret. She had a desire to linger in the
      opening of the charming spring there, for the little parks were brilliant
      with flower beds-tulips, hyacinths, crocuses, violets&mdash;the magnolias
      and redbuds in their prodigal splendor attracted the eye a quarter of a
      mile away, and the slender twigs of the trees began to be suffused with
      tender green. It was the sentimental time of the year. But Congress had
      gone, and whatever might be the promise of the season, Henderson had
      already gathered the fruits that had been forced in the hothouse of the
      session. He was in high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has all been so delightful, dear!&rdquo; said Margaret as they rode away in
      the train, and caught their last sight of the dome. They were in
      Hollowell&rsquo;s private car, which the good-natured old fellow had put at
      their disposal. And Margaret had a sense of how delightful and prosperous
      this world is as seen from a private car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Henderson answered, thinking of various things; &ldquo;it has been a
      successful winter. The capital is really attractive. It occurred to me the
      other day that America has invented a new kind of city, the apotheosis of
      the village&mdash;Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked of the city, of the acquaintances of the winter, of
      Hollowell&rsquo;s thoughtfulness in lending them his car, that their bridal
      trip, as he had said, might have a good finish. Margaret&rsquo;s heart opened to
      the world. She thought of the friends at Brandon, she thought of the poor
      old ladies she was accustomed to look after in the city, of the
      ragged-school that she visited, of the hospital in which she was a
      manager, of the mission chapel. The next Sunday would be Easter, and she
      thought of a hundred ways in which she could make it brighter for so many
      of the unfortunates. Her heart was opened to the world, and looking across
      to Henderson, who was deep in the morning paper, she said, with a wife&rsquo;s
      unblushing effrontery, &ldquo;Dearest, how handsome you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The home life took itself up again easily and smoothly in Washington
      Square. Did there ever come a moment of reflection as to the nature of
      this prosperity which was altogether so absorbing and agreeable? If it
      came, did it give any doubts and raise any of the old questions that used
      to be discussed at Brandon? Wasn&rsquo;t it the use that people made of money,
      after all, that was the real test? She did not like Hollowell, but on
      acquaintance he was not the monster that he had appeared to her in the
      newspapers. She was perplexed now and then by her husband&rsquo;s business, but
      did it differ from that of other men she had known, except that it was on
      a larger scale? And how much good could be done with money!
    </p>
    <p>
      On Easter morning, when Margaret returned from early service, to which she
      had gone alone, she found upon her dressing-table a note addressed to &ldquo;My
      Wife,&rdquo; and in it a check for a large sum to her order, and a card, on
      which was written, &ldquo;For Margaret&rsquo;s Easter Charities.&rdquo; Flushed with
      pleasure, she ran to meet her husband on the landing as he was descending
      to breakfast, threw her arms about his neck, and, with tears in her eyes,
      cried, &ldquo;Dearest, how good you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is such a good and prosperous generation.

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our lives are largely made up of the things we do not have. In May, the
      time of the apple blossoms&mdash;just a year from the swift wooing of
      Margaret&mdash;Miss Forsythe received a letter from John Lyon. It was in a
      mourning envelope. The Earl of Chisholm was dead, and John Lyon was Earl
      of Chisholm. The information was briefly conveyed, but with an air of
      profound sorrow. The letter spoke of the change that this loss brought to
      his own life, and the new duties laid upon him, which would confine him
      more closely to England. It also contained congratulations&mdash;which
      circumstances had delayed&mdash;upon Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s marriage, and a
      simple wish for her happiness. The letter was longer than it need have
      been for these purposes; it seemed to love to dwell upon the little visit
      to Brandon and the circle of friends there, and it was pervaded by a tone,
      almost affectionate, towards Miss Forsythe, which touched her very deeply.
      She said it was such a manly letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      America, the earl said, interested him more and more. In all history, he
      wrote, there never had been such an opportunity for studying the formation
      of society, for watching the working out of political problems; the
      elements meeting were so new, and the conditions so original, that
      historical precedents were of little service as guides. He acknowledged an
      almost irresistible impulse to come back, and he announced his intention
      of another visit as soon as circumstances permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had noticed this in English travelers of intelligence before. Crude as
      the country is, and uninteresting according to certain established
      standards, it seems to have a &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; quality, a certain unexplained
      fascination. Morgan says that it is the social unconventionality that
      attracts, and that the American women are the loadstone. He declares. that
      when an Englishman secures and carries home with him an American wife, his
      curiosity about the country is sated. But this is generalizing on narrow
      premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was certainly in Lyon&rsquo;s letter a longing to see the country again,
      but the impression it made upon me when I read it&mdash;due partly to its
      tone towards Miss Forsythe, almost a family tone&mdash;was that the
      earldom was an empty thing without the love of Margaret Debree. Life is so
      brief at the best, and has so little in it when the one thing that the
      heart desires is denied. That the earl should wish to come to America
      again without hope or expectation was, however, quite human nature. If a
      man has found a diamond and lost it, he is likely to go again and again
      and wander about the field where he found it, not perhaps in any defined
      hope of finding another, but because there is a melancholy satisfaction in
      seeing the spot again. It was some such feeling that impelled the earl to
      wish to see again Miss Forsythe, and perhaps to talk of Margaret, but he
      certainly had no thought that there were two Margaret Debrees in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her aunt&rsquo;s letter conveying the intelligence of Mr. Lyon&rsquo;s loss,
      Margaret replied with a civil message of condolence. The news had already
      reached the Eschelles, and Carmen, Margaret said, had written to the new
      earl a most pious note, which contained no allusion to his change of
      fortune, except an expression of sympathy with his now enlarged
      opportunity for carrying on his philanthropic plans&mdash;a most unworldly
      note. &ldquo;I used to think,&rdquo; she had said, when confiding what she had done to
      Margaret, &ldquo;that you would make a perfect missionary countess, but you have
      done better, my dear, and taken up a much more difficult work among us
      fashionable sinners. Do you know,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that I feel a great deal
      less worldly than I used to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret wrote a most amusing account of this interview, and added that
      Carmen was really very good-hearted, and not half as worldly-minded as she
      pretended to be; an opinion with which Miss Forsythe did not at all agree.
      She had spent a fortnight with Margaret after Easter, and she came back in
      a dubious frame of mind. Margaret&rsquo;s growing intimacy with Carmen was one
      of the sources of her uneasiness. They appeared to be more and more
      companionable, although Margaret&rsquo;s clear perception of character made her
      estimate of Carmen very nearly correct. But the fact remained that she
      found her company interesting. Whether the girl tried to astonish the
      country aunt, or whether she was so thoroughly a child of her day as to
      lack certain moral perceptions, I do not know, but her candid conversation
      greatly shocked Miss Forsythe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; she said one day, in one of her apparent bursts of confidence,
      &ldquo;seems to have had such a different start in life from mine. Sometimes,
      Miss Forsythe, she puzzles me. I never saw anybody so much in love as she
      is with Mr. Henderson; she doesn&rsquo;t simply love him, she is in love with
      him. I don&rsquo;t wonder she is fond of him&mdash;any woman might be that&mdash;but,
      do you know, she actually believes in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she believe in him?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Forsythe, in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, in a way,&rdquo; the girl went on. &ldquo;I like Mr. Henderson&mdash;I
      like him very much&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t believe in him. It isn&rsquo;t the way now
      to believe in anybody very much. We don&rsquo;t do it, and I think we get along
      just as well&mdash;and better. Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s nicer not to have any
      deceptions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Forsythe was too much stunned to make any reply. It seemed to her
      that the bottom had fallen out of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Henderson believes in people?&rdquo; the girl persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does not he isn&rsquo;t much of a man. If people don&rsquo;t believe in each
      other, society is going to pieces. I am astonished at such a tone from a
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t any tone in me, my dear Miss Forsythe,&rdquo; Carmen continued,
      sweetly. &ldquo;Society is a great deal pleasanter when you are not anxious and
      don&rsquo;t expect too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Forsythe told Margaret that she thought Miss Eschelle was a dangerous
      woman. Margaret did not defend her, but she did not join, either, in
      condemning her; she appeared to have accepted her as a part of her world.
      And there were other things that Margaret seemed to have accepted without
      that vigorous protest which she used to raise at whatever crossed her
      conscience. To her aunt she was never more affectionate, never more
      solicitous about her comfort and her pleasure, and it was almost enough to
      see Margaret happy, radiant, expanding day by day in the prosperity that
      was illimitable, only there was to her a note of unreality in all the
      whirl and hurry of the busy life. She liked to escape to her room with a
      book, and be out of it all, and the two weeks away from her country life
      seemed long to her. She couldn&rsquo;t reconcile Margaret&rsquo;s love of the world,
      her tolerance of Carmen, and other men and women whose lives seemed to be
      based on Carmen&rsquo;s philosophy, with her devotion to the church services, to
      the city missions, and the dozens of charities that absorb so much of the
      time of the leaders of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too young, dear, to be so good and devout,&rdquo; was Carmen&rsquo;s comment
      on the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Miss Forsythe&rsquo;s wonder, Margaret did not resent this impertinence, but
      only said that no accumulation of years was likely to bring Carmen into
      either of these dangers. And the reply was no more satisfactory to Miss
      Forsythe than the remark that provoked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she had had a delightful visit, that Margaret was more lovely than
      ever, that Henderson was a delightful host, was the report of Miss
      Forsythe when she returned to us. In a confidential talk with my wife she
      confessed, however, that she couldn&rsquo;t tell whither Margaret was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the worries of modern life is the perplexity where to spend the
      summer. The restless spirit of change affects those who dwell in the
      country, as well as those who live in the city. No matter how charming the
      residence is, one can stay in it only a part of the year. He actually
      needs a house in town, a villa by the sea, and a cottage in the hills.
      When these are secured&mdash;each one an establishment more luxurious year
      by year&mdash;then the family is ready to travel about, and is in a
      greater perplexity than before whether to spend the summer in Europe or in
      America, the novelties of which are beginning to excite the imagination.
      This nomadism, which is nothing less than society on wheels, cannot be
      satirized as a whim of fashion; it has a serious cause in&mdash;the
      discovery of the disease called nervous prostration, which demands for its
      cure constant change of scene, without any occupation. Henderson
      recognized it, but he said that personally he had no time to indulge in
      it. His summer was to be a very busy one. It was impossible to take
      Margaret with him on his sudden and tedious journeys from one end of the
      country to the other, but she needed a change. It was therefore arranged
      that after a visit to Brandon she should pass the warm months with the
      Arbusers in their summer home at Lenox, with a month&mdash;the right month&mdash;in
      the Eschelle villa at Newport; and he hoped never to be long absent from
      one place or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret came to Brandon at the beginning of June, just at the season when
      the region was at its loveliest, and just when its society was making
      preparations to get away from it to the sea, or the mountains, or to any
      place that was not home. I could never understand why a people who have
      been grumbling about snow and frost for six months, and longing for genial
      weather, should flee from it as soon as it comes. I had made the
      discovery, quite by chance&mdash;and it was so novel that I might have
      taken out a patent on it&mdash;that if one has a comfortable home in our
      northern latitude, he cannot do better than to stay in it when the hum of
      the mosquito is heard in the land, and the mercury is racing up and down
      the scale between fifty and ninety. This opinion, however, did not extend
      beyond our little neighborhood, and we may be said to have had the summer
      to ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fancied that the neighborhood had not changed, but the coming of
      Margaret showed me that this was a delusion. No one can keep in the same
      place in life simply by standing still, and the events of the past two
      years had wrought a subtle change in our quiet. Nothing had been changed
      to the eye, yet something had been taken away, or something had been
      added, a door had been opened into the world. Margaret had come home, yet
      I fancied it was not the home to her that she had been thinking about. Had
      she changed?
    </p>
    <p>
      She was more beautiful. She had the air&mdash;I should hesitate to call it
      that of the fine lady&mdash;of assured position, something the manner of
      that greater world in which the possession of wealth has supreme
      importance, but it was scarcely a change of manner so much as of ideas
      about life and of the things valuable in it gradually showing itself. Her
      delight at being again with her old friends was perfectly genuine, and she
      had never appeared more unselfish or more affectionate. If there was a
      subtle difference, it might very well be in us, though I found it
      impossible to conceive of her in her former role of teacher and simple
      maiden, with her heart in the little concerns of our daily life. And why
      should she be expected to go back to that stage? Must we not all live our
      lives? Miss Forsythe&rsquo;s solicitude about Margaret was mingled with a
      curious deference, as to one who had a larger experience of life than her
      own. The girl of a year ago was now the married woman, and was invested
      with something of the dignity that Miss Forsythe in her pure imagination
      attached to that position. Without yielding any of her opinions, this idea
      somehow changed her relations to Margaret; a little, I thought, to the
      amusement of Mrs. Fletcher and the other ladies, to whom marriage took on
      a less mysterious aspect. It arose doubtless from a renewed sense of the
      incompleteness of her single life, long as it had been, and enriched as it
      was by observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that June there were vexatious strikes in various parts of the country,
      formidable combinations of laboring-men, demonstrations of trades-unions,
      and the exhibition of a spirit that sharply called attention to the
      unequal distribution of wealth. The discontent was attributed in some
      quarters to the exhibition of extreme luxury and reckless living by those
      who had been fortunate. It was even said that the strikes, unreasonable
      and futile as they were, and most injurious to those who indulged in them,
      were indirectly caused by the railway manipulation, in the attempt not
      only to crush out competition, but to exact excessive revenues on
      fictitious values. Resistance to this could be shown to be blind, and the
      strikers technically in the wrong, yet the impression gained ground that
      there was something monstrously wrong in the way great fortunes were
      accumulated, in total disregard of individual rights, and in a
      materialistic spirit that did not take into account ordinary humanity. For
      it was not alone the laboring class that was discontented, but all over
      the country those who lived upon small invested savings, widows and
      minors, found their income imperiled by the trickery of rival operators
      and speculators in railways and securities, who treated the little private
      accumulations as mere counters in the games they were playing. The loss of
      dividends to them was poorly compensated by reflections upon the
      development of the country, and the advantage to trade of great
      consolidations, which inured to the benefit of half a dozen insolent men.
    </p>
    <p>
      In discussing these things in our little parliament we were not altogether
      unprejudiced, it must be confessed. For, to say nothing of interests of
      Mr. Morgan and my own, which seemed in some danger of disappearing for the
      &ldquo;public good,&rdquo; Mrs. Fletcher&rsquo;s little fortune was nearly all invested in
      that sound &ldquo;rock-bed&rdquo; railway in the Southwest that Mr. Jerry Hollowell
      had recently taken under his paternal care. She was assured, indeed, that
      dividends were only reserved pending some sort of reorganization, which
      would ultimately be of great benefit to all the parties concerned; but
      this was much like telling a hungry man that if he would possess his
      appetite in patience, he would very likely have a splendid dinner next
      year. Women are not constituted to understand this sort of reasoning. It
      is needless to say that in our general talks on the situation these
      personalities were not referred to, for although Margaret was silent, it
      was plain to see that she was uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morgan liked to raise questions of casuistry, such as that whether money
      dishonestly come by could be accepted for good purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had this question referred to me the other day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A gambler&mdash;not
      a petty cheater in cards, but a man who has a splendid establishment in
      which he has amassed a fortune, a man known for his liberality and
      good-fellowship and his interest in politics&mdash;offered the president
      of a leading college a hundred thousand dollars to endow a professorship.
      Ought the president to take the money, knowing how it was made?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t the money do good&mdash;as much good as any other hundred
      thousand dollars?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. But the professorship was to bear his name, and what would be
      the moral effect of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you recommend the president to take the money, if he could get it
      without using the gambler&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not saying yet what I advised. I am trying to get your views on a
      general principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t it be a sneaking thing to take a man&rsquo;s money, and refuse him
      the credit of his generosity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was it generosity? Was not his object, probably, to get a reputation
      which his whole life belied, and to get it by obliterating the distinction
      between right and wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it a compromising distinction,&rdquo; my wife asked, &ldquo;to take his
      money without his name? The president knows that it is money fraudulently
      got, that really belongs to somebody else; and the gambler would feel that
      if the president takes it, he cannot think very disapprovingly of the
      manner in which it was acquired. I think it would be more honest and
      straightforward to take his name with the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The public effect of connecting the gambler&rsquo;s name with the college would
      be debasing,&rdquo; said Morgan; &ldquo;but, on the contrary, is every charity or
      educational institution bound to scrutinize the source of every
      benefaction? Isn&rsquo;t it better that money, however acquired, should be used
      for a good purpose than a bad one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a question,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that is a vital one in our present
      situation, and the sophistry of it puzzles the public. What would you say
      to this case? A man notoriously dishonest, but within the law, and very
      rich, offered a princely endowment to a college very much in need of it.
      The sum would have enabled it to do a great work in education. But it was
      intimated that the man would expect, after a while, to be made one of the
      trustees. His object, of course, was social position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, of course,&rdquo; Margaret replied, &ldquo;that the college couldn&rsquo;t
      afford that. It would look like bribery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t he be satisfied with an LL.D.?&rdquo; Morgan asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; my wife said, &ldquo;any difference between the two cases stated
      and that of the stock gambler, whose unscrupulous operations have ruined
      thousands of people, who founds a theological seminary with the gains of
      his slippery transactions. By accepting his seminary the public condones
      his conduct. Another man, with the same shaky reputation, endows a
      college. Do you think that religion and education are benefited in the
      long-run by this? It seems to me that the public is gradually losing its
      power of discrimination between the value of honesty and dishonesty. Real
      respect is gone when the public sees that a man is able to buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a hot speech for my wife to make. For a moment Margaret flamed up
      under it with her old-time indignation. I could see it in her eyes, and
      then she turned red and confused, and at length said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wouldn&rsquo;t you have rich men do good with their money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, but I would not have them think they can blot out by their
      liberality the condemnation of the means by which many of them make money.
      That is what they are doing, and the public is getting used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Margaret, with some warmth, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that they are any
      worse than the stingy saints who have made their money by saving, and act
      as if they expected to carry it with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saints or sinners, it does not make much difference to me,&rdquo; now put in
      Mrs. Fletcher, who was evidently considering the question from a practical
      point of view, &ldquo;what a man professes, if he founds a hospital for indigent
      women out of the dividends that I never received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Morgan laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Mrs. Fletcher, that it is a good sign of
      the times, that so many people who make money rapidly are disposed to use
      it philanthropically?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be for them, but it does not console me much just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t make allowance enough for the rich. Perhaps they are under
      a necessity of doing something. I was reading this morning in the diary of
      old John Ward of Stratford-on-Avon this sentence: &lsquo;It was a saying of
      Navisson, a lawyer, that no man could be valiant unless he hazarded his
      body, nor rich unless he hazarded his soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Navisson a modern lawyer?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the diary is dated 1648-1679.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little laugh at this, and the talk drifted off into a
      consideration of the kind of conscience that enables a professional man to
      espouse a cause he knows to be wrong as zealously as one he knows to be
      right; a talk that I should not have remembered at all, except for
      Margaret&rsquo;s earnestness in insisting that she did not see how a lawyer
      could take up the dishonest side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Margaret went to Lenox, Henderson spent a few days with us. He
      brought with him the abounding cheerfulness, and the air of a prosperous,
      smiling world, that attended him in all circumstances. And how happy
      Margaret was! They went over every foot of the ground on which their brief
      courtship had taken place, and Heaven knows what joy there was to her in
      reviving all the tenderness and all the fear of it! Busy as Henderson was,
      pursued by hourly telegrams and letters, we could not but be gratified
      that his attention to her was that of a lover. How could it be otherwise,
      when all the promise of the girl was realized in the bloom and the
      exquisite susceptibility of the woman? Among other things, she dragged him
      down to her mission in the city, to which he went in a laughing and
      bantering mood. When he had gone away, Margaret ran over to my wife,
      bringing in her hand a slip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes dancing with pleasure. It was a check for
      a thousand dollars. &ldquo;That will refurnish the mission from top to bottom,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;and run it for a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How generous he is!&rdquo; cried my wife. Margaret did not reply, but she
      looked at the check, and there were tears in her eyes.

    <p>
      The Arbuser cottage at Lenox was really a magnificent villa. Richardson
      had built it. At a distance it had the appearance of a mediaeval
      structure, with its low doorways, picturesque gables, and steep roofs, and
      in its situation on a gentle swell of green turf backed by native
      forest-trees it imparted to the landscape an ancestral tone which is much
      valued in these days. But near to, it was seen to be mediaevalism adapted
      to the sunny hospitality of our summer climate, with generous verandas and
      projecting balconies shaded by gay awnings, and within spacious, open to
      the breezes, and from its broad windows offering views of lawns and
      flower-beds and ornamental trees, of a great sweep of pastures and forests
      and miniature lakes, with graceful and reposeful hills on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in short, the modern idea of country simplicity. The passion for
      country life, which has been in decadence for nearly half a century, has
      again become the fashion. Nature, which, left to itself, is a little
      ragged, not to say monotonous and tiresome, is discovered to be a valuable
      ally for aid in passing the time when art is able to make portions of it
      exclusive. What the Arbusers wanted was a simple home in the country, and
      in obtaining it they were indulging a sentiment of returning to the
      primitive life of their father, who had come to the city from a hill farm,
      and had been too busy all his life to recur to the tastes of his boyhood.
      At least that was the theory of his daughters; but the old gentleman had a
      horror of his early life, and could scarcely be dragged away from the city
      even in the summer. He would no doubt have been astonished at the lofty
      and substantial stone stables, the long range of greenhouses, and at a
      farm which produced nothing except lawns and flower-beds, ornamental
      fields of clover, avenues of trees, lawn-tennis grounds, and a few
      Alderneys tethered to feed among the trees, where their beauty would
      heighten the rural and domestic aspect of the scene. The Arbusers liked to
      come to this place as early as possible to escape the society exactions of
      the city. That was another theory of theirs. All their set in the city met
      there for the same purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was welcomed with open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been counting the days,&rdquo; said the elder of the sisters. &ldquo;Your
      luggage has come, your rooms are all ready, and your coachman, who has
      been here some days, says that the horses need exercise. Everybody is
      here, and we need you for a hundred things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind. It is so charming here. I knew it would be, but I
      couldn&rsquo;t bear to shorten my visit in Brandon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your aunt must miss you very much. Is she well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t she have come with you? I&rsquo;ve a mind to telegraph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. She is wedded to quiet, and goes away from her little
      neighborhood with reluctance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Brandon was a little dull?&rdquo; said Miss Arbuser, with a shrewd guess at
      the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; quickly replied Margaret, shrinking a little from what was in her
      own mind; &ldquo;it was restful and delightful; but you know that we New England
      people take life rather seriously, and inquire into the reason of things,
      and want an object in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very good thing to have,&rdquo; answered this sweet woman of the world, whose
      object was to go along pleasantly and enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to have it all the time!&rdquo; Margaret suggested, lightly, as she ran
      up-stairs. But even in this suggestion she was conscious of a twinge of
      disloyalty to her former self. Deep down in her heart, coming to the
      atmosphere of Lenox was a relief from questionings that a little disturbed
      her at her old home, and she was indignant at herself that it should be
      so, and then indignant at the suggestions that put her out of humor with
      herself. Was it a sin, she said, to be happy and prosperous?
    </p>
    <p>
      On her dressing-table was a letter from her husband. He was detained in
      the city by a matter of importance. He scratched only a line, to catch the
      mail, during a business interview. It was really only a business
      interview, and had no sort of relation to Lenox or the summer gayety
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was in his private office. The clerks in the outer offices, in
      the neglige of summer costumes, winked to each other as they saw old Jerry
      Hollowell enter and make his way to the inner room unannounced. Something
      was in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, old man,&rdquo; said Uncle Jerry, in the cheeriest manner, coming in,
      depositing his hat on the table, and taking a seat opposite Henderson, &ldquo;we
      seem to have stirred up the animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little flurry,&rdquo; replied Henderson, laying down his pen and folding
      a note he had just finished; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll come to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got to.&rdquo; Mr. Hollowell drew out a big bandanna and mopped his
      heated face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got a letter from Jorkins. There&rsquo;s the
      certificates that make up the two-thirds-more than we need, anyway. No
      flaw about that, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll put these with the balance in the safe. It&rsquo;s all right, if
      Jorkins has been discreet. It may make a newspaper scandal if they get
      hold of his operations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jorkins is close. But he is a little overworked. I don&rsquo;t know but it
      would do him good to have a little nervous prostration and go abroad for a
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it would do Jorkins good to take a turn in Europe for a year or
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you write to him. Give him a sort of commission to see the English
      bondholders, and explain the situation. They will appreciate that half a
      loaf is better than no bread. What bothers me is the way the American
      bondholders take it. They kick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let &lsquo;em kick. The public don&rsquo;t care for a few soreheads and
      impracticables in an operation that is going to open up the whole
      Southwest. I&rsquo;ve an appointment with one of them this morning. He ought to
      be here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Henderson&rsquo;s private secretary entered and laid on the table
      the card of Mr. John Hopper, who was invited to come in at once. Mr.
      Hopper was a man of fifty, with iron-gray hair, a heavy mustache, and a
      smooth-shaven chin that showed resolution. In dress and manner his
      appearance was that of the shrewd city capitalist&mdash;quiet and
      determined, who is neither to be deceived nor bullied. With a courteous
      greeting to both the men, whom he knew well, he took a seat and stated his
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have called to see you, Mr. Henderson, about the bonds of the A. and
      B., and I am glad to find Mr. Hollowell here also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What amount do you represent, Mr. Hopper?&rdquo; asked Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my own and my friends&rsquo;, altogether, rising a million. What do you
      propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got our circular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and we don&rsquo;t accept the terms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. It is the best that we could do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, the best you would do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Hopper, the best we could do under the circumstances. We
      gave you your option, to scale down on a fair estimate of the earnings of
      the short line (the A. and B.), or to surrender your local bonds and take
      new ones covering the whole consolidation, or, as is of course in your
      discretion, to hold on and take the chances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which your operations have practically destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Mr. Hopper. We offer you a much better security on the whole
      system instead of a local road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you mean to tell me, Mr. Henderson, that it is for our advantage to
      exchange a seven per cent. bond on a road that has always paid its
      interest promptly, for a four and a half on a system that is manipulated
      nobody knows how? I tell you, gentlemen, that it looks to outsiders as if
      there was crookedness somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a rather rough charge, Mr. Hopper,&rdquo; said Henderson, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we are to understand that if we do not accept your terms, it&rsquo;s a
      freeze-out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are to understand that we want to make the best arrangement possible
      for all parties in interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How some of those interests were acquired may be a question for the
      courts,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hopper, resolutely. &ldquo;When we put our money in good
      seven per cent. bonds, we propose to inquire into the right of anybody to
      demand that we shall exchange them for four and a half per cents. on other
      security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly right, Mr. Hopper,&rdquo; said Henderson, with imperturbable
      good-humor; &ldquo;the transfer books are open to your inspection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we prefer to hold on to our bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And wait for your interest,&rdquo; interposed Hollowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hopper turned to the speaker. &ldquo;And while we are waiting we propose to
      inquire what has become of the surplus of the A. and B. The bondholders
      had the first claim on the entire property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we propose to protect it. See here, Mr. Hopper,&rdquo; continued Uncle
      Jerry, with a most benevolent expression, &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t tell you that
      investments fluctuate&mdash;the Lord knows mine do! The A. and B. was a
      good road. I know that. But it was going to be paralleled. We&rsquo;d got to
      parallel it to make our Southwest connections. If we had, you&rsquo;d have
      waited till the Gulf of Mexico freezes over before you got any coupons
      paid. Instead of that, we took it into our system, and it&rsquo;s being put on a
      permanent basis. It&rsquo;s a little inconvenient for holders, and they have got
      to stand a little shrinkage, but in the long-run it will be better for
      everybody. The little road couldn&rsquo;t stand alone, and the day of big
      interest is about over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That explanation may satisfy you, Mr. Hollowell, but it don&rsquo;t give us our
      money, and I notify you that we shall carry the matter into the courts.
      Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Hopper had gone, the two developers looked at each other a moment
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hopper &lsquo;ll fight,&rdquo; Hollowell said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we have got the surplus to fight him with,&rdquo; replied Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; and Uncle Jerry chuckled to himself. &ldquo;The rats that are on
      the inside of the crib are a good deal better off than the rats on the
      outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The reporter of The Planet wants five minutes,&rdquo; announced the secretary,
      opening the door. Henderson told him to let him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter was a spruce young gentleman, in a loud summer suit, with a
      rose in his button-hole, and the air of assurance which befits the
      commissioner of the public curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sent by The Planet,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;to show you this and ask
      you if you have anything to say to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the A. and B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. There is the president, Mr. Hollowell. Show it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The reporter produced a long printed slip and handed it to Uncle Jerry,
      who took it and began to read. As his eye ran down the column he was
      apparently more and more interested, and he let it be shown on his face
      that he was surprised, and even a little astonished. When he had finished,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my young friend, how did you get hold of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we have a way,&rdquo; said the reporter, twirling his straw hat by the
      elastic, and looking more knowing than old Jerry himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; replied Jerry, with an admiring smile; &ldquo;there is nothing that
      you newspaper folks don&rsquo;t find out. It beats the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, sir?&rdquo; said the young gentleman, elated with this recognition
      of his own shrewdness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so true that there is no fun in it. I don&rsquo;t see how the devil you
      got hold of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any explanations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess not,&rdquo; said Uncle Jerry, musingly. &ldquo;If it is to come out, I&rsquo;d
      rather The Planet would have it than any, other paper. It&rsquo;s got some
      sense. No; print it. It&rsquo;ll be a big beat for your paper. While you are
      about it&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll print it anyway?&rdquo; (the reporter nodded)&mdash;&ldquo;you
      might as well have the whole story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. We&rsquo;d like to have it right. What is wrong about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing but some details. You have got it substantially. There&rsquo;s a
      word or two and a date you are out on, naturally enough, and there are two
      or three little things that would be exactly true if they were differently
      stated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind telling me what they are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jerry, with a little reluctance; &ldquo;might as well have it all out&mdash;eh,
      Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old man took his pencil and changed some dates and a name or two,
      and gave to some of the sentences a turn that seemed to the reporter only
      another way of saying the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that is all I know. Give my respects to Mr. Goss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the commissioner had withdrawn, Uncle Jerry gave vent to a long
      whistle. Then he rose suddenly and called to the secretary, &ldquo;Tell that
      reporter to come back.&rdquo; The reporter reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just thinking, and you can tell Mr. Goss, that now you have got
      onto this thing, you might as well keep the lead on it. The public is
      interested in what we are doing in the Southwest, and if you, or some
      other bright fellow who has got eyes in his head, will go down there, he
      will see something that will astonish him. I&rsquo;m going tomorrow in my
      private car, and if you could go along, I assure you a good time. I want
      you to see for yourself, and I guess you would. Don&rsquo;t take my word. I
      can&rsquo;t give you any passes, and I know you don&rsquo;t want any, but you can just
      get into my private car and no expense to anybody, and see all there is to
      be seen. Ask Goss, and let me know tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow went off feeling several inches higher than when he came
      in. Such is the power of a good address, and such is the omnipotence of
      the great organ. Mr. Jerry Hollowell sat down and began to fan himself. It
      was very hot in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s lunch-time. Great Scott! what a lot of time I used to
      waste fighting the newspapers! That thing would have played the devil as
      it stood. It will be comparatively harmless now. It will make a little
      talk, but there is nothing to get hold of. Queer, about the difference of
      a word or two. Come, old man, I&rsquo;m thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jerry,&rdquo; said Henderson, taking his arm as they went out, &ldquo;you ought
      to be President of the United States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The salary is too small,&rdquo; said Uncle Jerry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all this there was nothing to write to Margaret, who was passing her
      time agreeably in the Berkshire hills, a little impatient for her
      husband&rsquo;s arrival, postponed from day to day, and full of sympathy for
      him, condemned to the hot city and the harassment of a business the
      magnitude of which gave him the obligations and the character of a public
      man. Henderson sent her instead a column from The Planet devoted to a
      description of his private library. Mr. Goss, the editor, who was college
      bred, had been round to talk with Henderson about the Southwest trip, and
      the conversation drifting into other matters, Henderson had taken from his
      desk and shown him a rare old book which he had picked up the day before
      in a second-hand shop. This led to further talk about Henderson&rsquo;s hobby,
      and the editor had asked permission to send a reporter down to make a note
      of Henderson&rsquo;s collection. It would make a good midsummer item, &ldquo;The
      Stock-Broker in Literature,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Private Tastes of a Millionaire,&rdquo; etc.
      The column got condensed into a portable paragraph, and went the rounds of
      the press, and changed the opinions of a good many people about the great
      operator&mdash;he wasn&rsquo;t altogether devoted to vulgar moneymaking. Uncle
      Jerry himself read the column with appreciation of its value. &ldquo;It diverts
      the public mind,&rdquo; he said. He himself had recently diverted the public
      mind by the gift of a bell to the Norembega Theological (colored)
      Institute, and the paragraph announcing the fact conveyed the impression
      that while Uncle Jerry was a canny old customer, his heart was on the
      right side. &ldquo;There are worse men than Uncle Jerry who are not worth a
      cent,&rdquo; was one of the humorous paragraphs tacked on to the item.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret was not alone in finding the social atmosphere of Lenox as
      congenial as its natural beauties. Mrs. Laflamme declared that it was the
      perfection of existence for a couple of months, one in early summer and
      another in the golden autumn with its pathetic note of the falling curtain
      dropping upon the dream of youth. Mrs. Laflamme was not a sentimental
      person, but she was capable of drifting for a moment into a poetic mood&mdash;a
      great charm in a woman of her vivacity and air of the world. Margaret
      remembered her very distinctly, although she had only exchanged a word
      with her at the memorable dinner in New York when Henderson had revealed
      her feelings to herself. Mrs. Laflamme had the immense advantage&mdash;it
      seemed so to her after five years of widowhood of being a widow on the
      sunny side of thirty-five. If she had lost some illusions she had gained a
      great deal of knowledge, and she had no feverish anxiety about what life
      would bring her. Although she would not put it in this way to herself, she
      could look about her deliberately, enjoying the prospect, and please
      herself. Her position had two advantages&mdash;experience and opportunity.
      A young woman unmarried, she said, always has the uneasy sense of the
      possibility&mdash;well, it is impossible to escape slang, and she said it
      with the merriest laugh&mdash;the possibility of being left. A day or two
      after Margaret&rsquo;s arrival she had driven around to call in her dog-cart,
      looking as fresh as a daisy in her sunhat. She held the reins, but her
      seat was shared by Mr. Fox McNaughton, the most useful man in the village,
      indispensable indeed; a bachelor, with no intentions, no occupation, no
      ambition (except to lead the german), who could mix a salad, brew a punch,
      organize a picnic, and chaperon anything in petticoats with entire
      propriety, without regard to age. And he had a position of social
      authority. This eminence Mr. Fox McNaughton had attained by always doing
      the correct thing. The obligation of society to such men is never enough
      acknowledged. While they are trusted and used, and worked to death, one is
      apt to hear them spoken of in a deprecatory tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hold the reins a moment, please. No, I don&rsquo;t want any help,&rdquo; she
      said, as she jumped down with an elastic spring, and introduced him to
      Margaret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Mr. McNaughton in training, and am thinking of
      bringing him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked in with Margaret, chatting about the view and the house and the
      divine weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your husband has not come yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may come any day. I think business might suspend in the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I. But then, what would become of Lenox? It is rather hard on the
      men, only I dare say they like it. Don&rsquo;t you think Mr. Henderson would
      like a place here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot help being pleased with Lenox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he would if you are. I have hardly seen him since that evening
      at the Stotts&rsquo;. Can I tell you?&mdash;I almost had five minutes of envy
      that evening. You won&rsquo;t mind it in such an old woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should rather trust your heart than your age, Mrs. Laflamme,&rdquo; said
      Margaret, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my heart is as old as my face. But I had a feeling, seeing you walk
      away that evening into the conservatory. I knew what was coming. I think I
      have discovered a great secret, Mrs. Henderson to be able to live over
      again in other people. By-the-way, what has become of that quiet
      Englishman, Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has come into his title. He is the Earl of Chisholm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, how stupid in us not to have taken a sense of that! And the
      Eschelles&mdash;do you know anything of the Eschelles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they are at their house in Newport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think there was anything between Miss Eschelle and Mr. Lyon? I saw
      her afterwards several times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I ever heard. Miss Eschelle says that she is thoroughly American
      in her tastes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then her tastes are not quite conformed to her style. That girl might be
      anything&mdash;Queen of Spain, or coryphee in the opera ballet. She is
      clever as clever. One always expects to hear of her as the heroine of an
      adventure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say you knew her in Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We heard of her and her mother everywhere. She was very independent.
      She had the sort of reputation to excite curiosity. But I noticed that the
      men in New York were a little afraid of her. She is a woman who likes to
      drive very near the edge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Laflamme rose. &ldquo;I must not keep Mr. McNaughton waiting for any more
      of my gossip. We expect you and the Misses Arbuser this afternoon. I warn
      you it will be dull. I should like to hear of some summer resort where the
      men are over sixteen and under sixty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Laflamme liked to drive near the edge as much as Carmen did, and this
      piquancy was undeniably an attraction in her case. But there was this
      difference between the two: there was a confidence that Mrs. Laflamme
      would never drive over the edge, whereas no one could tell what sheer
      Carmen might not suddenly take. A woman&rsquo;s reputation is almost as much
      affected by the expectation of what she may do as by anything she has
      done. It was Fox McNaughton who set up the dictum that a woman may do
      almost anything if it is known that she draws a line somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawn party was not at all dull to Margaret. In the first place, she
      received a great deal of attention. Henderson&rsquo;s name was becoming very
      well known, and it was natural that the splendor of his advancing fortune
      should be reflected in the person of his young wife, whose loveliness was
      enhanced by her simple enjoyment of the passing hour. Then the toilets of
      the women were so fresh and charming, the colors grouped so prettily on
      the greensward, the figures of the slender girls playing at tennis or
      lounging on the benches under the trees, recalled scenes from the classic
      poets. It was all so rich and refined. Nor did she miss the men of
      military age, whose absence Mrs. Laflamme had deplored, for she thought of
      her husband. And, besides, she found even the college boys (who are always
      spoken of as men) amusing, and the elderly gentlemen&mdash;upon whom
      watering-place society throws much responsibility&mdash;gallant,
      facetious, complimentary, and active in whatever was afoot. Their
      boyishness, indeed, contrasted with&mdash;the gravity of the
      undergraduates, who took themselves very seriously, were civil to the
      young ladies,&mdash;confidential with the married women, and had generally
      a certain reserve and dignity which belong to persons upon whom such heavy
      responsibility rests.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, to be sure, men who looked bored, and women who were listless,
      missing the stimulus of any personal interest; but the scene was so
      animated, the weather so propitious, that, on the whole, a person must be
      very cynical not to find the occasion delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a young novelist present whose first story, &ldquo;The Girl I Left
      Behind Me,&rdquo; had made a hit the last season. It was thought to take a
      profound hold upon life, because it was a book that could not be read
      aloud in a mixed company. Margaret was very much interested in him,
      although Mr. Summers Bass was not her idea of an imaginative writer. He
      was a stout young gentleman, with very black hair and small black eyes, to
      which it was difficult to give a melancholy cast even by an habitual
      frown. Mr. Bass dressed himself scrupulously in the fashion, was very
      exact in his pronunciation, careful about his manner, and had the air of a
      little weariness, of the responsibility of one looking at life. It was
      only at rare moments that his face expressed intensity of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very pretty scene. I suppose, Mr. Bass, that you are making
      studies,&rdquo; said Margaret, by way of opening a conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; hardly that. One must always observe. It gets to be a habit. The
      thing is to see reality under appearances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would call yourself a realist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bass smiled. &ldquo;That is a slang term, Mrs. Henderson. What you want is
      nature, color, passion&mdash;to pierce the artificialities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must describe appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, to an extent&mdash;form, action, talk as it is, even
      trivialities&mdash;especially the trivialities, for life is made up of the
      trivial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose that does not interest me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, Mrs. Henderson, that is because you are used to the
      conventional, the selected. Nature is always interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not find it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Nature has been covered up; it has been idealized. Look yonder,&rdquo; and
      Mr. Bass pointed across the lawn. &ldquo;See that young woman upon whom the
      sunlight falls standing waiting her turn. See the quivering of the
      eyelids, the heaving of the chest, the opening lips; note the curve of her
      waist from the shoulder, and the line rounding into the fall of the folds
      of the Austrian cashmere. I try to saturate myself with that form, to
      impress myself with her every attitude and gesture, her color, her
      movement, and then I shall imagine the form under the influence of
      passion. Every detail will tell. I do not find unimportant the tie of her
      shoe. The picture will be life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose, Mr. Bass, when you come to speak with her, you find that she
      has no ideas, and talks slang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the better. It shows what we are, what our society is. And besides,
      Mrs. Henderson, nearly everybody has the capacity of being wicked; that is
      to say, of expressing emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take a gloomy view, Mr. Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take no view, Mrs. Henderson. My ambition is to record. It will not
      help matters by pretending that people are better than they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Bass, you may be quite right, but I am not going to let you
      spoil my enjoyment of this lovely scene,&rdquo; said Margaret, moving away. Mr.
      Bass watched her until she disappeared, and then entered in his notebook a
      phrase for future use, &ldquo;The prosperous propriety of a pretty plutocrat.&rdquo;
       He was gathering materials for his forthcoming book, &ldquo;The Last Sigh of the
      Prude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole world knows how delightful Lenox is. It even has a club where
      the men can take refuge from the exactions of society, as in the city. The
      town is old enough to have &ldquo;histories&rdquo;; there is a romance attached to
      nearly every estate, a tragedy of beauty, and money, and disappointment;
      great writers have lived here, families whose names were connected with
      our early politics and diplomacy; there is a tradition of a society of wit
      and letters, of women whose charms were enhanced by a spice of adventure,
      of men whose social brilliancy ended in misanthropy. All this gave a
      background of distinction to the present gayety, luxury, and adaptation of
      the unsurpassed loveliness of nature to the refined fashion of the age.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, if anywhere, one could be above worry, above the passion of envy;
      for did not every new &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; and every new refinement in living add
      to the importance of every member of this favored community? For Margaret
      it was all a pageant of beauty. The Misses Arbuser talked about the
      quality of the air, the variety of the scenery, the exhilaration of the
      drives, the freedom from noise and dust, the country quiet. There were the
      morning calls, the intellectual life of the reading clubs, the tennis
      parties, the afternoon teas, combined with charming drives from one
      elegant place to another; the siestas, the idle swinging in hammocks, with
      the latest magazine from which to get a topic for dinner, the mild
      excitement of a tete-a-tete which might discover congenial tastes or run
      on into an interesting attachment. Half the charm of life, says a
      philosopher, is in these personal experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henderson came, as he did several times for a few days, Margaret&rsquo;s
      happiness was complete. She basked in the sun of his easy enjoyment of
      life. She liked to take him about with her, and see the welcome in all
      companies of a man so handsome, so natural and cordial, as her husband.
      Especially aid she like the consideration in which he was evidently held
      at the club, where the members gathered about him to listen to his racy
      talk and catch points about the market. She liked to think that he was not
      a woman&rsquo;s man. He gave her his version of some recent transactions that
      had been commented on in the newspapers, and she was indignant over the
      insinuations about him. It was the price, he said, that everybody had to
      pay for success. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he, she reflected, make money? Everybody
      would if they could, and no one knew how generous he was. If she had been
      told that the family of Jerry Hollowell thought of him in the same way,
      she would have said that there was a world-wide difference in the two men.
      Insensibly she was losing the old standards she used to apply to success.
      Here in Lenox, in this prosperous, agreeable world, there was nothing to
      remind her of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her enjoyment of this existence without care, I do not suppose it
      occurred to her to examine if her ideals had been lowered. Sometimes
      Henderson had a cynical, mocking tone about the world, which she reproved
      with a caress, but he was always tolerant and good-natured. If he had told
      her that he acted upon the maxim that every man and woman has his and her
      price she would have been shocked, but she was getting to make allowances
      that she would not have made before she learned to look at the world
      through his eyes. She could see that the Brandon circle was
      over-scrupulous. Her feeling of this would have been confirmed if she had
      known that when her aunt read the letter announcing a month&rsquo;s visit to the
      Eschelles in Newport, she laid it down with a sigh.

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Uncle Jerry was sitting on the piazza of the Ocean House, absorbed in the
      stock reports of a New York journal, answering at random the occasional
      observations of his wife, who filled up one of the spacious chairs near
      him&mdash;a florid woman, with diamonds in her ears, who had the resolute
      air of enjoying herself. It was an August Newport morning, when there is a
      salty freshness in the air, but a temperature that discourages exertion. A
      pony phaeton dashed by containing two ladies. The ponies were
      cream-colored, with flowing manes and tails, and harness of black and
      gold; the phaeton had yellow wheels with a black body; the diminutive page
      with folded arms, on the seat behind, wore a black jacket and yellow
      breeches. The lady who held the yellow silk reins was a blonde with dark
      eyes. As they flashed by, the lady on the seat with her bowed, and Mr.
      Hollowell returned the salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Hollowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mrs. Henderson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know her. She knows how to handle the ribbons, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen her at the Casino the other night, before you come, with that
      tandem-driving count. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s any more count than you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right. He&rsquo;s one of the Spanish legation. This is just the
      place for counts. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder, Maria, if you&rsquo;d like to be a
      countess. We can afford it&mdash;the Countess Jeremiah, eh?&rdquo; and Uncle
      Jerry&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose, Mr. Hollowell,&rdquo; bringing her fat hands round in front
      of her, so that she could see the sparkle of the diamond rings on them.
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s as pretty as a picture, that girl, but I should think a good wind
      would blow her away. I shouldn&rsquo;t want to have her drive me round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jorkins has sailed,&rdquo; said Mr. Hollowell, looking up from his paper. &ldquo;The
      Planet reporter tried to interview him, but he played sick, said he was
      just going over and right back for a change. I guess it will be long
      enough before they get a chance at him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s gone. I hope the papers will mind their own business for a
      spell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house of the Eschelles was on the sea, looking over a vast sweep of
      lawn to the cliff and the dimpling blue water of the first beach. It was
      known as the Yellow Villa. Coming from the elegance of Lenox, Margaret was
      surprised at the magnificence and luxury of this establishment, the great
      drawing-rooms, the spacious chambers, the wide verandas, the pictures, the
      flowers, the charming nooks and recessed windows, with handy book-stands,
      and tables littered with the freshest and most-talked-of issues from the
      press of Paris, Madrid, and London. Carmen had taken a hint from
      Henderson&rsquo;s bachelor apartment, which she had visited once with her
      mother, and though she had no literary taste, further than to dip in here
      and there to what she found toothsome and exciting in various languages,
      yet she knew the effect of the atmosphere of books, and she had a standing
      order at a book-shop for whatever was fresh and likely to come into
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Carmen was a delightful hostess, both because her laziness gave an air
      of repose to the place, and she had the tact never to appear to make any
      demands upon her guests, and because she knew when to be piquant and
      exhibit personal interest, and when to show even a little abandon of
      vivacity. Society flowed through her house without any obstructions. It
      was scarcely ever too early and never too late for visitors. Those who
      were intimate used to lounge in and take up a book, or pass an hour on the
      veranda, even when none of the family were at home. Men had a habit of
      dropping in for a five o&rsquo;clock cup of tea, and where the men went the
      women needed little urging to follow. At first there had been some
      reluctance about recognizing the Eschelles fully, and there were still
      houses that exhibited a certain reserve towards them, but the example of
      going to this house set by the legations, the members of which enjoyed a
      chat with Miss Eschelle in the freedom of their own tongues and the
      freedom of her tongue, went far to break down this barrier. They were
      spoken of occasionally as &ldquo;those Eschelles,&rdquo; but almost everybody went
      there, and perhaps enjoyed it all the more because there had been a shade
      of doubt about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s coming was a good card for Carmen. The little legend about her
      French ancestry in Newport, and the romantic marriage in Rochambeau&rsquo;s
      time, had been elaborated in the local newspaper, and when she appeared
      the ancestral flavor, coupled with the knowledge of Henderson&rsquo;s
      accumulating millions, lent an interest and a certain charm to whatever
      she said and did. The Eschelle house became more attractive than ever
      before, so much so that Mrs. Eschelle declared that she longed for the
      quiet of Paris. To her motherly apprehension there was no result in this
      whirl of gayety, no serious intention discoverable in any of the train
      that followed Carmen. &ldquo;You act, child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as if youth would last
      forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret entered into this life as if she had been born to it. Perhaps she
      was. Perhaps most people never find the career for which they are fitted,
      and struggle along at cross-purposes with themselves. We all thought that
      Margaret&rsquo;s natural bent was for some useful and self-sacrificing work in
      the world, and never could have imagined that under any circumstances she
      would develop into a woman of fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to read a great deal this month,&rdquo; she said to Carmen on her
      arrival, as she glanced at the litter of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my intention,&rdquo; replied Carmen; &ldquo;now we can read together. I&rsquo;m
      taking Spanish lessons of Count Crispo. I&rsquo;ve learned two Spanish poems and
      a Castilian dance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now. He told me, when he was teaching me the steps, that his heart
      was buried in Seville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be full of sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is because his salary is so small. Mamma says, of all things
      an impecunious count! But he is amusing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you care for money?&rdquo; asked Margaret, by way of testing
      Carmen&rsquo;s motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, my dear. But deliver me from a husband who is poor; he would
      certainly be a tyrant. Besides, if I ever marry, it will be with an
      American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose you fall in love with a poor man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be against my principles. Never fall below your ideals&mdash;that
      is what I heard a speaker say at the Town and Country Club, and that is my
      notion. There is no safety for you if you lose your principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon what they are,&rdquo; said Margaret, in the same bantering
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds like good Mr. Lyon. I suspect he thought I hadn&rsquo;t any. Mamma
      said I tried to shock him; but he shocked me. Do you think you could live
      with such a man twenty-four hours, even if he had his crown on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can imagine a great deal worse husbands than the Earl of Chisholm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t any imagination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no reading that day nor the next. In the morning there was a
      drive with the ponies through town, in the afternoon in the carriage by
      the sea, with a couple of receptions, the five o&rsquo;clock tea, with its
      chatter, and in the evening a dinner party for Margaret. One day sufficed
      to launch her, and there-after Carmen had only admiration for the
      unflagging spirit which Margaret displayed. &ldquo;If you were only unmarried,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;what larks we could have!&rdquo; Margaret looked grave at this, but
      only for a moment, for she well knew that she could not please her husband
      better than by enjoying the season to the full. He never criticised her
      for taking the world as it is; and she confessed to herself that life went
      very pleasantly in a house where there were never any questions raised
      about duties. The really serious thought in Carmen&rsquo;s mind was that perhaps
      after all a woman had no real freedom until she was married. And she began
      to be interested in Margaret&rsquo;s enjoyment of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, after all, a new world, only newly arranged, like another
      scene in the same play. The actors, who came and went, were for the most
      part the acquaintances of the Washington winter, and the callers and
      diners and opera-goers and charity managers of the city. In these days
      Margaret was quite at home with the old set: the British Minister, the
      Belgian, the French, the Spanish, the Mexican, the German, and the
      Italian, with their families and attaches&mdash;nothing was wanting, not
      even the Chinese mandarin, who had rooms at the hotel, going about
      everywhere in the conscientious discharge of his duties as ambassador to
      American society, a great favorite on account of his silk apparel, which
      gave him the appearance of a clumsy woman, and the everlasting,
      three-thousand-year-old smile on his broad face, punctiliously leaving in
      every house a big flaring red piece of paper which the ladies pinned up
      for a decoration; a picture of helpless, childlike enjoyment, and almost
      independent of the interpreter who followed him about, when he had
      learned, upon being introduced to a lady, or taking a cup of tea, to say
      &ldquo;good-by&rdquo; as distinctly as an articulating machine; a truly learned man,
      setting an example of civility and perfect self-possession, but keenly
      observant of the oddities of the social life to which his missionary
      government had accredited him. One would like to have heard the comments
      of the minister and his suite upon our manners; but perhaps they were too
      polite to make any even in their seclusion. Certain it is that no one ever
      heard any of the legation express any opinion but the most suave and
      flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet they must have been amazed at the activity of this season of
      repose, the endurance of American women who rode to the fox meets, were
      excited spectators of the polo, played lawn-tennis, were incessantly
      dining and calling, and sat through long dinners served with the formality
      and dullness and the swarms of liveried attendants of a royal feast. And
      they could not but admire the young men, who did not care for politics or
      any business beyond the chances of the stock exchange, but who expended an
      immense amount of energy in the dangerous polo contests, in riding at
      fences after the scent-bag, in driving tandems and four-in-hands, and yet
      had time to dress in the cut and shade demanded by every changing hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly the annual chronicle of this summer pageant, in which the same
      women appeared day after day, and the same things were done over and over
      again, Margaret used to read with a contempt for the life; but that she
      enjoyed it, now she was a part of it, shows that the chroniclers for the
      press were unable to catch the spirit of it, the excitement of the
      personal encounters that made it new every day. Looking at a ball is quite
      another thing from dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is lively enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Ponsonby, one afternoon when they had
      returned from the polo grounds and were seated on the veranda. Mr.
      Ponsonby was a middle-aged Englishman, whose diplomatic labors at various
      courts had worn a bald spot on his crown. Carmen had not yet come, and
      they were waiting for a cup of tea. &ldquo;And they ride well; but I think I
      rather prefer the Wild West Show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You Englishmen,&rdquo; Margaret retorted, &ldquo;seem to like the uncivilized. Are
      you all tired of civilization?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of some kinds. When we get through with the London season, you know, Mrs.
      Henderson, we like to rough it, as you call it, for some months. But, &lsquo;pon
      my word, I can&rsquo;t see much difference between Washington and Newport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might get up a Wild West Show here, or a prize-fight, for you. Do you
      know, Mr. Ponsonby, I think it will take full another century for women to
      really civilize men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the cruelty and love of brutal sports out of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d cease to like us. Nothing is so insipid, I fancy, to a woman
      as a man made in her own image.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have you against Newport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against it? I&rsquo;m sure nothing could be better than this.&rdquo; And Mr. Ponsonby
      allowed his adventurous eyes to rest for a moment upon Margaret&rsquo;s trim
      figure, until he saw a flush in her face. &ldquo;This prospect,&rdquo; he added,
      turning to the sea, where a few sails took the slant rays of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Where every prospect pleases,&rdquo;&rsquo; quoted Margaret, &ldquo;&lsquo;and only man&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Mrs. Henderson; men are not to be considered. The
      women in Newport would make the place a paradise even if it were a
      desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is another thing I object to in men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flattery. You don&rsquo;t say such things to each other at the club. What is
      your objection to Newport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I had any. But if you compel me well, the whole thing seems
      to be a kind of imitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the way things go on&mdash;the steeple-chasing and fox-hunting, and
      the carts, and the style of the swell entertainments. Is that
      ill-natured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. I like candor, especially English candor. But there is Miss
      Eschelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carmen drove up with Count Crispo, threw the reins to the groom, and
      reached the ground with a touch on the shoulder of the count, who had
      alighted to help her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;Mr. Ponsonby says that all Newport is just an
      imitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it is. We are all imitations, except Count Crispo. I&rsquo;ll bet a
      cup of tea against a pair of gloves,&rdquo; said Carmen, who had facility in
      picking up information, &ldquo;that Mr. Ponsonby wasn&rsquo;t born in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ponsonby looked redder than usual, and then laughed, and said, &ldquo;Well,
      I was only three years old when I left Halifax.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; cried Carmen, clapping her hands. &ldquo;Now come in and have a cup
      of English breakfast tea. That&rsquo;s imitation, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mistake you made,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;was not being born in Spain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s not irreparable,&rdquo; the count interposed, with an air of
      gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Carmen, audaciously; &ldquo;by this time I should be buried in
      Seville. No, I should prefer Halifax, for it would have been a pleasure to
      emigrate from Halifax. Was it not, Mr. Ponsonby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember. But it is a pleasure to sojourn in any land with Miss
      Eschelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Now you shall have two cups. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, Mr. Jerry Hollowell, having inquired where Margaret was
      staying, called to pay his respects, as he phrased it. Carmen, who was
      with Margaret in the morning-room, received him with her most
      distinguished manner. &ldquo;We all know Mr. Hollowell,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not always an advantage,&rdquo; retorted Uncle Jerry, seating himself,
      and depositing his hat beside his chair. &ldquo;When do you expect your husband,
      Mrs. Henderson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow. But I don&rsquo;t mean to tell him that you are here&mdash;not at
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Carmen; &ldquo;we women want Mr. Henderson a little while to
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m the idlest man in America. I tell Henderson that he ought to
      take more time for rest. It&rsquo;s no good to drive things. I like quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you get it in Newport?&rdquo; Margaret asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my wife and children get what they call quiet. I guess a month of
      it would use me up. She says if I had a place here I&rsquo;d like it. Perhaps
      so. You are very comfortably fixed, Miss Eschelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does very well for us, but something more would be expected of Mr.
      Hollowell. We are just camping-out here. What Newport needs is a real
      palace, just to show those foreigners who come here and patronize us. Why
      is it, Mr. Hollowell, that all you millionaires can&rsquo;t think of anything
      better to do with your money than to put up a big hotel or a great
      elevator or a business block?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Uncle Jerry, blandly, &ldquo;that is because they are
      interested in the prosperity of the country, and have simple democratic
      tastes for themselves. I&rsquo;m afraid you are not democratic, Miss Eschelle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m anxious about the public also. I&rsquo;m on your side, Mr. Hollowell;
      but you don&rsquo;t go far enough. You just throw in a college now and then to
      keep us quiet, but you owe it to the country to show the English that a
      democrat can have as fine a house as anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call that real patriotism. When I get rich, Miss Eschelle, I&rsquo;ll bear it
      in mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you never will be rich,&rdquo; said Carmen, sweetly, bound to pursue her
      whim. &ldquo;You might come to me for a start to begin the house. I was very
      lucky last spring in A. and B. bonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that? Are you interested in A. and B.?&rdquo; asked Uncle Jerry,
      turning around with a lively interest in this gentle little woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; we sold out. We sold when we heard what an interest there was in
      the road. Mamma said it would never do for two capitalists to have their
      eggs in the same basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Carmen?&rdquo; asked Margaret, startled. &ldquo;Why, that is the
      road Mr. Henderson is in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know, dear. There were too many in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it safe?&rdquo; said Margaret, turning to Hollowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal more solid than it was,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It is part of a
      through line. I suppose Miss Eschelle found a better investment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One nearer home,&rdquo; she admitted, in the most matter-of-fact way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henderson must have given the girl points,&rdquo; thought Hollowell. He began
      to feel at home with her. If he had said the truth, it would have been
      that she was more his kind than Mrs. Henderson, but that he respected the
      latter more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we might go in partnership, Miss Eschelle, to mutual advantage&mdash;but
      not in building. Your ideas are too large for me there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be a very unreliable partner, Mr. Hollowell; but I could enlarge
      your ideas, if I had time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hollowell laughed, and said he hadn&rsquo;t a doubt of that. Margaret inquired
      for Mrs. Hollowell and the children, and she and Carmen appointed an hour
      for calling at the Ocean House. The talk went to other topics, and after a
      half-hour ended in mutual good-feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful old party!&rdquo; said Carmen, after he had gone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
      mind to adopt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a week Hollowell and Carmen were the best of friends. She called him
      &ldquo;Uncle Jerry,&rdquo; and buzzed about him, to his great delight. &ldquo;The beauty of
      it is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you never can tell where she will light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody knows what Newport is in August, and we need not dwell on it. To
      Margaret, with its languidly moving pleasures, its well-bred scenery, the
      luxury that lulled the senses into oblivion of the vulgar struggle and
      anxiety which ordinarily attend life, it was little less than paradise. To
      float along with Carmen, going deeper and deeper into the shifting gayety
      which made the days fly without thought and with no care for tomorrow,
      began to seem an admirable way of passing life. What could one do fitter,
      after all, for a world hopelessly full of suffering and poverty and
      discontent, than to set an example of cheerfulness and enjoyment, and to
      contribute, as occasion offered, to the less fortunate? Would it help
      matters to be personally anxious and miserable? To put a large bill in the
      plate on Sunday, to open her purse wide for the objects of charity and
      relief daily presented, was indeed a privilege and a pleasure, and a
      satisfaction to the conscience which occasionally tripped her in her rapid
      pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you have a bit of conscience,&rdquo; said Margaret to Carmen
      one Sunday, as they walked home from morning service, when Margaret had
      responded &ldquo;extravagantly,&rdquo; as Carmen said, to an appeal for the mission
      among the city pagans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said I had, dear. It must be the most troublesome thing you can
      carry around with you. Of course I am interested in the heathen, but
      charity&mdash;that is where I agree with Uncle Jerry&mdash;begins at home,
      and I don&rsquo;t happen to know a greater heathen than I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were as bad as you make yourself out, I wouldn&rsquo;t walk with you
      another step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you ask mother. She was in such a rage one day when I told Mr. Lyon
      that he&rsquo;d better look after Ireland than go pottering round among the
      neglected children. Not that I care anything about the Irish,&rdquo; added this
      candid person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wanted to make it pleasant for Mr. Lyon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; for mother. She can&rsquo;t get over the idea that she is still bringing me
      up. And Mr. Lyon! Goodness! there was no living with him after his visit
      to Brandon. Do you know, Margaret, that I think you are just a little bit
      sly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said Margaret, looking offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, I don&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; said the impulsive creature, wheeling short
      round and coming close to Margaret. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d kiss you this minute if we were
      not in the public road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Henderson came, Margaret&rsquo;s world was full; no desire was ungratified.
      He experienced a little relief when she did not bother him about his
      business nor inquire into his operations with Hollowell, and he fancied
      that she was getting to accept the world as Carmen accepted it. There had
      been moments since his marriage when he feared that Margaret&rsquo;s scruples
      would interfere with his career, but never a moment when he had doubted
      that her love for him would be superior to any solicitations from others.
      Carmen, who knew him like a book, would have said that the model wife for
      Henderson would be a woman devoted to him and to his interests, and not
      too scrupulous. A wife is a torment, if you can&rsquo;t feel at ease with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were only a French fleet in the harbor, dear,&rdquo; said Margaret one
      day, &ldquo;I should feel that I had quite taken up the life of my
      great-great-grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were sailing in Hollowell&rsquo;s yacht, in which Uncle Jerry had brought
      his family round from New York. He hated the water, but Mrs. Hollowell and
      the children doted on the sea, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t the torpedo station make up for it?&rdquo; Henderson asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly. But it shows the change of a hundred years. Only, isn&rsquo;t it odd,
      this personal dropping back into an old situation? I wonder what she was
      like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The accounts say she was the belle of Newport. I suppose Newport has a
      belle once in a hundred years. The time has come round. But I confess I
      don&rsquo;t miss the French fleet,&rdquo; replied Henderson, with a look of love that
      thrilled Margaret through and through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would have been an officer on the fleet, and I should have fallen
      in love with you. Ah, well, it is better as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was better. The days went by without a cloud. Even after Henderson
      had gone, the prosperity of life filled her heart more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might have been like me,&rdquo; Carmen said to herself, &ldquo;if she had only
      started right; but it is so hard to get rid of a New England conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Margaret stayed in her room, one morning, to write a long-postponed
      letter to her aunt, she discovered that she had very little to write, at
      least that she wanted to write, to her aunt. She began, however,
      resolutely with a little account of her life. But it seemed another thing
      on paper, addressed to the loving eyes at Brandon. There were too much
      luxury and idleness and triviality in it, too much Carmen and Count Crispo
      and flirtation and dissipation in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tore it up, and went to the window and looked out upon the sea. She
      was indignant with the Brandon people that they should care so little
      about this charming life. She was indignant at herself that she had torn
      up the letter. What had she done that anybody should criticise her? Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t she live her life, and not be hampered everlastingly by
      comparisons?
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down again, and took up her pen. Was she changing&mdash;was she
      changed? Why was it that she had felt a little relief when her last
      Brandon visit was at an end, a certain freedom in Lenox and a greater
      freedom in Newport? The old associations became strong again in her mind,
      the life in the little neighborhood, the simplicity of it, the high ideals
      of it, the daily love and tenderness. Her aunt was no doubt wondering now
      that she did not write, and perhaps grieving that Margaret no more felt at
      home in Brandon. It was too much. She loved them, she loved them all
      dearly. She would write that, and speak only generally of her frivolous,
      happy summer. And she began, but somehow the letter seemed stiff and to
      lack the old confiding tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why should they disapprove of her? She thought of her husband. If
      circumstances had altered, was she to blame? Could she always be thinking
      of what they would think at Brandon? It was an intolerable bondage. They
      had no right to set themselves up over her. Suppose her aunt didn&rsquo;t like
      Carmen. She was not responsible for Carmen. What would they have her do?
      Be unhappy because Henderson was prosperous, and she could indulge her
      tastes and not have to drudge in school? Suppose she did look at some
      things differently from what she used to. She knew more of the world. Must
      you shut yourself up because you found you couldn&rsquo;t trust everybody? What
      was Mr. Morgan always hitting at? Had he any better opinion of men and
      women than her husband had? Was he any more charitable than Uncle Jerry?
      She smiled as she thought of Uncle Jerry and his remark&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very
      decent world if you don&rsquo;t huff it.&rdquo; No; she did like this life, and she
      was not going to pretend that she didn&rsquo;t. It would be dreadful to lose the
      love and esteem of her dear old friends, and she cried a little as this
      possibility came over her. And then she hardened her heart a little at the
      thought that she could not help it if they chose to misunderstand her and
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen was calling from the stairs that it was time to dress for the
      drive. She dashed off a note. It contained messages of love for everybody,
      but it was the first one in her life written to her aunt not from her
      heart.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Shall we never have done with this carping at people who succeed? Are
      those who start and don&rsquo;t arrive any better than those who do arrive? Did
      not men always make all the money they had an opportunity to make? Must we
      always have the old slow-coach merchants and planters thrown up to us?
      Talk of George Washington and the men of this day! Were things any better
      because they were on a small scale? Wasn&rsquo;t the thrifty George Washington
      always adding to his plantations, and squeezing all he could out of his
      land and his slaves? What are the negro traditions about it? Were they all
      patriots in the Revolutionary War? Were there no contractors who amassed
      fortunes then? And how was it in the late war? The public has a great
      spasm of virtue all of a sudden. But we have got past the day of
      stage-coaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like this Henderson was flinging out to Carmen as he paced back
      and forth in her parlor. It was very unlike him, this outburst, and Carmen
      knew that he would indulge in it to no one else, not even to Uncle Jerry.
      She was coiled up in a corner of the sofa, her eyes sparkling with
      admiration of his indignation and force. I confess that he had been
      irritated by the comments of the newspapers, and by the prodding of the
      lawyers in the suit then on trial over the Southwestern consolidation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there was old Mansfield saying in his argument that he had had some
      little experience in life, but he never had known a man to get rich
      rapidly, barring some piece of luck, except by means that it would make
      him writhe to have made public. I don&rsquo;t know but that Uncle Jerry was
      right, that we made a mistake in not retaining him for the corporation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you win,&rdquo; said Carmen, softly. &ldquo;The public won&rsquo;t care for the
      remark unless you fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he tried to prejudice the Court by quoting the remark attributed to
      Uncle Jerry, &lsquo;The public be d&mdash;&mdash;d&rsquo; as if, said Mansfield, the
      public has no rights as&mdash;against the railroad wreckers. Uncle Jerry
      laughed, and interrupted: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense, reporters&rsquo; nonsense. What I
      said was that if the public thought I was fool enough to make it our
      enemy, the public might be d&mdash;-d (begging your honor&rsquo;s pardon).&rsquo; Then
      everybody laughed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the bond holders, who want big dividends, that
      stand in the way of the development of the country, that&rsquo;s what it is,&rsquo; 
      said he, as he sat down, to those around him, but loud enough to be heard
      all over the room. Mansfield asked the protection of the Court against
      these clap-trap interruptions. The judge said it was altogether irregular,
      and Uncle Jerry begged pardon. The reporters made this incident the one
      prominent thing in the case that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a delightful Uncle Jerry it is!&rdquo; said Carmen. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep an
      eye on him, Rodney; he&rsquo;ll be giving your money to that theological
      seminary in Alabama.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; Henderson said, cooling down, &ldquo;of a paragraph in The
      Planet, the other day, about the amount of my gifts unknown to the public.
      I showed it to Uncle Jerry, and he said, &lsquo;Yes, I mentioned it to the
      editor; such things don&rsquo;t do any harm.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it, and wondered who started it,&rdquo; Carmen replied, wrinkling her
      brows as if she had been a good deal perplexed about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Henderson, with a smile, &ldquo;that it ought to be explained
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, reflectively; &ldquo;you are liberal enough, goodness knows&mdash;too
      liberal&mdash;but you are not a flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was in the habit of dropping in at the Eschelles&rsquo; occasionally,
      when he wanted to talk freely. He had no need to wear a mask with Carmen.
      Her moral sense was tolerant and elastic, and feminine sympathy of this
      sort is a grateful cushion. She admired Henderson, without thinking any
      too well of the world in general, and she admired him for the qualities
      that were most conformable to his inclination. It was no case of
      hero-worship, to be sure, nor for tragedy; but then what a satisfaction it
      must be to sweet Lady Macbeth, coiled up on her sofa, to feel that the
      thane of Cawdor has some nerve!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hendersons had come back to Washington Square late in the autumn. It
      is a merciful provision that one has an orderly and well-appointed home to
      return to from the fatigues of the country. Margaret, at any rate, was a
      little tired with the multiform excitements of her summer, and experienced
      a feeling of relief when she crossed her own threshold and entered into
      the freedom and quiet of her home. She was able to shut the door there
      even against the solicitations of nature and against the weariness of it
      also. How quiet it was in the square in those late autumn days, and yet
      not lifeless by any means! Indeed, it seemed all the more a haven because
      the roar of the great city environed it, and one could feel, without being
      disturbed by, the active pulsation of human life. And then, if one has
      sentiment, is there anywhere that it is more ministered to than in the
      city at the close of the year? The trees in the little park grow red and
      yellow and brown, the leaves fall and swirl and drift in windrows by the
      paths, the flower-beds flame forth in the last dying splendor of their
      color; the children, chasing each other with hoop and ball about the
      walks, are more subdued than in the spring-time; the old men, seeking now
      the benches where the sunshine falls, sit in dreamy reminiscence of the
      days that are gone; the wandering minstrel of Italy turns the crank of his
      wailing machine, O! bella, bella, as in the spring, but the notes seem to
      come from far off and to be full of memory rather than of promise; and at
      early morning, or when the shadows lengthen at evening, the south wind
      that stirs the trees has a salt smell, and sends a premonitory shiver of
      change to the fading foliage. But how bright are the squares and the
      streets, for all this note of melancholy! Life is to begin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the social season opened languidly. It takes some time to recover from
      the invigoration of the summer gayety&mdash;to pick up again the threads
      and weave them into that brilliant pattern, which scarcely shows all its
      loveliness of combination and color before the weavers begin to work in
      the subdued tints of Lent. How delightful it is to see this knitting and
      unraveling of the social fabric year after year! and how untiring are the
      senders of the shuttles, the dyers, the hatchelers, the spinners, the
      ever-busy makers and destroyers of the intricate web we call society!
      After one campaign, must there not be time given to organize for another?
      Who has fallen out, who are the new recruits, who are engaged, who will
      marry, who have separated, who has lost his money? Before we can safely
      reorganize we must not only examine the hearts but the stock-list. No
      matter how many brilliant alliances have been arranged, no matter how many
      husbands and wives have drifted apart in the local whirlpools of the
      summer&rsquo;s current, the season will be dull if Wall Street is torpid and
      discouraged. We cannot any of us, you see, live to ourselves alone. Does
      not the preacher say that? And do we not all look about us in the pews,
      when he thus moralizes, to see who has prospered? The B&rsquo;s have taken a
      back seat, the C&rsquo;s have moved up nearer the pulpit. There is a reason for
      these things, my friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sorry to say that Margaret was usually obliged to go alone to the
      little church where she said her prayers; for however restful her life
      might have been while that season was getting under way, Henderson was
      involved in the most serious struggle of his life&mdash;a shameful kind of
      conspiracy, Margaret told Carmen, against him. I have hinted at his
      annoyance in the courts. Ever since September he had been pestered with
      injunctions, threatened with attachments. And now December had come and
      Congress was in session; in the very first days an investigation had been
      ordered into the land grants involved in the Southwestern operations.
      Uncle Jerry was in Washington to explain matters there, and Henderson,
      with the ablest counsel in the city, was fighting in the courts. The
      affair made a tremendous stir. Some of the bondholders of the A. and B.
      happened to be men of prominence, and able to make a noise about their
      injury. As several millions were involved in this one branch of the case&mdash;the
      suit of the bondholders&mdash;the newspapers treated it with the
      consideration and dignity it deserved. It was a vast financial operation,
      some said, scathingly, a &ldquo;deal,&rdquo; but the magnitude of it prevented it from
      falling into the reports of petty swindling that appear in the
      police-court column. It was a public affair, and not to be judged by one&rsquo;s
      private standard. I know that there were remarks made about Henderson that
      would have pained Margaret if she had heard them, but I never heard that
      he lost standing in the street. Still, in justice to the street it must be
      said that it charitably waits for things to be proven, and that if
      Henderson had failed, he might have had little more lenient judgment in
      the street than elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, those were very trying days for him-days when he needed all the
      private sympathy he could get, and to be shielded, in his great fight with
      the conspiracy, from petty private annoyances. It needed all his courage
      and good-temper and bonhomie to carry him through. That he went through
      was evidence not only of his adroitness and ability, but it was proof also
      that he was a good fellow. If there were people who thought otherwise, I
      never heard that they turned their backs on him, or failed in that
      civility which he never laid aside in his intercourse with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a man present a smiling front to the world under extreme trial, is not
      that all that can be expected of him? Shall he not be excused for showing
      a little irritation at home when things go badly? Henderson was as
      good-humored a man as I ever knew, and he loved Margaret, he was proud of
      her, he trusted her. Since when did the truest love prevent a man from
      being petulant, even to the extent of wounding those he best loves,
      especially if the loved one shows scruples when sympathy is needed? The
      reader knows that the present writer has no great confidence in the
      principle of Carmen; but if she had been married, and her husband had
      wrecked an insurance company and appropriated all the surplus belonging to
      the policy-holders, I don&rsquo;t believe she would have nagged him about it.

      And yet Margaret loved Henderson with her whole soul. And in this stage of
      her progress in the world she showed that she did, though not in the way
      Carmen would have showed her love, if she had loved, and if she had a soul
      capable of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been inferred from Henderson&rsquo;s exhibition of temper that his
      case had gone against him. It is true; an injunction had been granted in
      the lower court, and public opinion went with the decree, and was in a
      great measure satisfied by it. But this fight had really only just begun;
      it would go on in the higher courts, with new resources and infinite
      devices, which the public would be unable to fathom or follow, until
      by-and-by it would come out that a compromise had been made, and the easy
      public would not understand that this compromise gave the looters of the
      railway substantially all they ever expected to get. The morning after the
      granting of the injunction Henderson had been silent and very much
      absorbed at breakfast, hardly polite, Margaret thought, and so inattentive
      to her remarks that she asked him twice whether they should accept the
      Brandon invitation to Christmas. &ldquo;Christmas! I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve got other
      things to think of than Christmas,&rdquo; he said, scarcely looking at her, and
      rising abruptly and going away to his library.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the postman brought Margaret&rsquo;s mail there was a letter in it from her
      aunt, which she opened leisurely after the other notes had been glanced
      through, on the principle that a family letter can wait, or from the fancy
      that some have of keeping the letter likely to be most interesting till
      the last. But almost the first line enchained her attention, and as she
      read, her heart beat faster, and her face became scarlet. It was very
      short, and I am able to print it, because all Margaret&rsquo;s correspondence
      ultimately came into possession of her aunt:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;BRANDON, December 17th.<br /><br /> &ldquo;DEAREST MARGARET,&mdash;You do not
        say whether you will come for Christmas, but we infer from your silence
        that you will. You know how pained we shall all be if you do not. Yet I
        fear the day will not be as pleasant as we could wish. In fact, we are
        in a good deal of trouble. You know, dear, that poor Mrs. Fletcher had
        nearly every dollar of her little fortune invested in the A. and B.
        bonds, and for ten months she has not had a cent of income, and no
        prospect of any. Indeed, Morgan says that she will be lucky if she
        ultimately saves half her principal. We try to cheer her up, but she is
        so cast down and mortified to have to live, as she says, on charity. And
        it does make rather close house-keeping, though I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t live
        alone without her. It does not make so much difference with Mr.
        Fairchild and Mr. Morgan, for they have plenty of other resources. Mr.
        Fairchild tells her that she is in very good company, for lots of the
        bonds are held in Brandon, and she is not the only widow who suffers;
        but this is poor consolation. We had great hopes, the other day, of the
        trial, but Morgan says it may be years before any final settlement. I
        don&rsquo;t believe Mr. Henderson knows. But there, dearest, I won&rsquo;t find
        fault. We are all well, and eager to see you. Do come.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;Your
        affectionate aunt,<br /> <br /> &ldquo;GEORGIAN A.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s hand that held the letter trembled, and the eyes that read
      these words were hot with indignation; but she controlled herself into an
      appearance of calmness as she marched away with it straight to the
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she entered, Henderson was seated at his desk, with bowed head and
      perplexed brows, sorting a pile of papers before him, and making notes. He
      did not look up until she came close to him and stood at the end of his
      desk. Then, turning his eyes for a moment, and putting out his left hand
      to her, he said, &ldquo;Well, what is it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you read that?&rdquo; said Margaret, in a voice that sounded strange in
      her own ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A letter from Aunt Forsythe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Family matter. Can&rsquo;t it wait?&rdquo; said Henderson, going on with his
      figuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it can, I cannot,&rdquo; Margaret answered, in a tone that caused him to
      turn abruptly and look at her. He was so impatient and occupied that even
      yet he did not comprehend the new expression in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see I am busy, child? I have an engagement in twenty minutes in
      my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can read it in a moment,&rdquo; said Margaret, still calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson took the letter with a gesture of extreme annoyance, ran his eye
      through it, flung it from him on the table, and turned squarely round in
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ruin poor Mrs. Fletcher and a hundred like her!&rdquo; cried Margaret, with
      rising indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I to do with it? Did I make their investments? Do you think I
      have time to attend to every poor duck? Why don&rsquo;t people look where they
      put their money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame, a burning shame!&rdquo; she cried, regarding him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; no doubt. I lost a hundred thousand yesterday; did I whine about
      it? If I want to buy anything in the market, have I got to look into every
      tuppenny interest concerned in it? If Mrs. Fletcher or anybody else has
      any complaint against me, the courts are open. I defy the whole pack!&rdquo;
       Henderson thundered out, rising and buttoning his coat&mdash;&ldquo;the whole
      pack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have nothing else to say, Rodney?&rdquo; Margaret persisted, not
      quailing in the least before his indignation. He had never seen her so
      before, and he was now too much in a passion to fully heed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, women, women!&rdquo; he said, taking up his hat, &ldquo;you have sympathy enough
      for anybody but your husbands.&rdquo; He pushed past her, and was gone without
      another word or look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret turned to follow him. She would have cried &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; but the word
      stuck in her throat. She was half beside herself with rage for a moment.
      But he had gone. She heard the outer door close. Shame and grief overcame
      her. She sat down in the chair he had just occupied. It was infamous the
      way Mrs. Fletcher was treated. And her husband&mdash;her husband was so
      regardless of it. If he was not to blame for it, why didn&rsquo;t he tell her&mdash;why
      didn&rsquo;t he explain? And he had gone away without looking at her. He had
      left her for the first time since they were married without kissing her!
      She put her head down on the desk and sobbed; it seemed as if her heart
      would break. Perhaps he was angry, and wouldn&rsquo;t come back, not for ever so
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      How cruel to say that she did not sympathize with her husband! How could
      he be angry with her for her natural anxiety about her old friend! He was
      unjust. There must be something wrong in these schemes, these great
      operations that made so many confiding people suffer. Was everybody
      grasping and selfish? She got up and walked about the dear room, which
      recalled to her only the sweetest memories; she wandered aimlessly about
      the lower part of the house. She was wretchedly unhappy. Was her husband
      capable of such conduct? Would he cease to love her for what she had done&mdash;for
      what she must do? How lovely this home was! Everything spoke of his care,
      his tenderness, his quickness to anticipate her slightest wish or whim. It
      had been all created for her. She looked listlessly at the pictures, the
      painted ceiling, where the loves garlanded with flowers chased each other;
      she lifted and let drop wearily the rich hangings. He had said that it was
      all hers. How pretty was this vista through the luxurious rooms down to
      the green and sunny conservatory. And she shrank instinctively from it
      all. Was it hers? No; it was his. And was she only a part of it? Was she
      his? How cold his look as he went away!
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this love, this divine passion, of which we hear so much? Is it,
      then, such a discerner of right and wrong? Is it better than anything
      else? Does it take the place of duty, of conscience? And yet what an
      unbearable desert, what a den of wild beasts it would be, this world,
      without love, the passionate, all-surrendering love of the man and the
      woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the chambers, in her own apartments, into which she dragged her steps,
      it was worse than below. Everything here was personal. Mrs. Fairchild had
      said that it was too rich, too luxurious; but her husband would have it
      so. Nothing was too costly, too good, for the woman he loved. How happy
      she had been in this boudoir, this room, her very own, with her books, the
      souvenirs of all her happy life!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed alien now, external, unsympathetic. Here, least of all places,
      could she escape from herself, from her hateful thoughts. It was a chilly
      day, and a bright fire crackled on the hearth. The square was almost
      deserted, though the sun illuminated it, and showed all the delicate
      tracery of the branches and twigs. It was a December sun. Her easy-chair
      was drawn to the fire and her book-stand by it, with the novel turned down
      that she had been reading the night before. She sat down and took up the
      book. She had lost her interest in the characters. Fiction! What stuff it
      was compared to the reality of her own life! No, it was impossible. She
      must do something. She went to her dressing-room and selected a street
      dress. She took pleasure in putting on the plainest costume she could
      find, rejecting every ornament, everything but the necessary and the
      simple. She wanted to get back to herself. Her maid appeared in response
      to the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going out, Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will madame have the carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will walk; I need exercise. Tell Jackson not to serve lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she would walk; for it was his carriage, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after mid-day. In the keen air and the bright sunshine the streets
      were brilliant. Margaret walked on up the avenue. How gay was the city,
      what a zest of life in the animated scene! The throng increased as she
      approached Twenty-third Street. In the place where three or four currents
      meet there was the usual jam of carriages, furniture wagons, carts, cars,
      and hurried, timid, half-bewildered passengers trying to make their way
      through it. It was all such a whirl and confusion. A policeman aided
      Margaret to gain the side of the square. Children were playing there;
      white-capped maids were pushing about baby-carriages; the sparrows
      chattered and fought with as much vivacity as if they were natives of the
      city instead of foreigners in possession. It seemed all so empty and
      unreal. What was she, one woman with an aching heart, in the midst of it
      all? What had she done? How could she have acted otherwise? Was he still
      angry with her? The city was so vast and cruel. On the avenue again there
      was the same unceasing roar of carts and carriages; business, pleasure,
      fashion, idleness, the stream always went by. From one and another
      carriage Margaret received a bow, a cool nod, or a smile of greeting.
      Perhaps the occupants wondered to see her on foot and alone. What did it
      matter? How heartless it all was! what an empty pageant! If he was
      alienated, there was nothing. And yet she was right. For a moment she
      thought of the Arbusers. She thought of Carmen. She must see somebody. No,
      she couldn&rsquo;t talk. She couldn&rsquo;t trust herself. She must bear it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how weary it was, walking, walking, with such a burden! House after
      house, street after street, closed doors, repellant fronts, staring at
      her. Suppose she were poor and hungry, a woman wandering forlorn, how
      stony and pitiless these insolent mansions! And was she not burdened and
      friendless and forlorn! Tired, she reached at last, and with no purpose,
      the great white cathedral. The door was open. In all this street of
      churches and palaces there was no other door open. Perhaps here for a
      moment she could find shelter from the world, a quiet corner where she
      could rest and think and pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered. It was almost empty, but down the vista of the great columns
      hospitable lights gleamed, and here and there a man or a woman&mdash;more
      women than men&mdash;was kneeling in the great aisle, before a picture, at
      the side of a confessional, at the steps of the altar. How hushed and calm
      and sweet it was! She crept into a pew in a side aisle in the shelter of a
      pillar; and sat down. Presently, in the far apse, an organ began to play,
      its notes stealing softly out through the great spaces like a benediction.
      She fancied that the saints, the glorified martyrs in the painted windows
      illumined by the sunlight, could feel, could hear, were touched by human
      sympathy in their beatitude. There was peace here at any rate, and perhaps
      strength. What a dizzy whirl it all was in which she had been borne along!
      The tones of the organ rose fuller and fuller, and now at the side
      entrances came pouring in children, the boys on one side, the girls on
      another-school children with their books and satchels, the poor children
      of the parish, long lines of girls and of boys, marshaled by priests and
      nuns, streaming in&mdash;in frolicsome mood, and filling all the pews of
      the nave at the front. They had their books out, their singing-books; at a
      signal they all stood up; a young priest with his baton stepped into the
      centre aisle; he waved his stick, Margaret heard his sweet tenor voice,
      and then the whole chorus of children&rsquo;s voices rising and filling all the
      house with the innocent concord, but always above all the penetrating,
      soaring notes of the priest-strong, clear, persuading. Was it not almost
      angelic there at the moment? And how inspired the beautiful face of the
      singer leading the children!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, me! it is not all of the world worldly, then. I don&rsquo;t know that the
      singing was very good: it was not classical, I fear; not a voice, maybe,
      that priest&rsquo;s, not a chorus, probably, that, for the Metropolitan. I hear
      the organ is played better elsewhere. Song after song, chorus after
      chorus, repeated, stopped, begun again: it was only drilling the little
      urchins of the parochial schools&mdash;little ragamuffins, I dare say,
      many of them. What was there in this to touch a woman of fashion, sitting
      there crying in her corner? Was it because they were children&rsquo;s voices,
      and innocent? Margaret did not care to check her tears. She was thinking
      of her old home, of her own childhood, nay, of her girlhood&mdash;it was
      not so long ago&mdash;of her ideals then, of her notion of the world and
      what it would bring her, of the dear, affectionate life, the simple life,
      the school, the little church, her room in the cottage&mdash;the chamber
      where first the realization of love came to her with the odors of May. Was
      it gone, that life?&mdash;gone or going out of her heart? And&mdash;great
      heavens!&mdash;if her husband should be cold to her! Was she very worldly?
      Would he love her if she were as unworldly as she once was? Why should
      this childish singing raise these contrasts, and put her at odds so with
      her own life? For a moment I doubt not this dear girl saw herself as we
      were beginning to see her. Who says that the rich and the prosperous and
      the successful do not need pity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this a comforting hour, do you think, for Margaret in the cathedral?
      Did she get any strength, I wonder? When the singing was over and the
      organ ceased, and the children had filed out, she stole away also, wearily
      and humbly enough, and took the stage down the avenue. It was near the
      dinner-hour, and Henderson, if he came, would be at home any moment. It
      seemed as if she could not wait&mdash;only to see him!

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Do you suppose that Henderson had never spoken impatiently and sharply to
      his wife before, that Margaret had never resented it and replied with
      spirit, and been hurt and grieved, and that there had never been
      reconciliations? In writing any biography there are some things that are
      taken for granted with an intelligent public. Are men always gentle and
      considerate, and women always even-tempered and consistent, simply by
      virtue of a few words said to the priest?
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was a more serious affair. Margaret waited in a tumult of
      emotion. She felt that she would die if she did not see him soon, and she
      dreaded his coming. A horrible suspicion had entered her mind that respect
      for her husband, confidence in him, might be lowered, and a more horrible
      doubt that she might lose his love. That she could not bear. And was
      Henderson unconscious of all this? I dare say that in the perplexing
      excitement of the day he did recall for a moment with a keen thrust of
      regret the scene of the morning-his wife standing there flushed, wounded,
      indignant. &ldquo;I might have turned back, and taken her in my arms, and told
      her it was all right,&rdquo; he thought. He wished he had done so. But what
      nonsense it was to think that she could be seriously troubled! Besides, he
      couldn&rsquo;t have women interfering with him every moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      How inconsiderate men are! They drop a word or a phrase&mdash;they do not
      know how cruel it is&mdash;or give a look&mdash;they do not know how cold
      it is&mdash;and are gone without a second thought about it; but it sinks
      into the woman&rsquo;s heart and rankles there. For the instant it is like a
      mortal blow, it hurts so, and in the brooding spirit it is exaggerated
      into a hopeless disaster. The wound will heal with a kind word, with
      kisses. Yes, but never, never without a little scar. But woe to the
      woman&rsquo;s love when she becomes insensible to these little stabs!
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson hurried home, then, more eagerly than usual, with reparation in
      his heart, but still with no conception of the seriousness of the breach.
      Margaret heard the key in the door, heard his hasty step in the hall,
      heard him call, as he always did on entering, &ldquo;Margaret! where is
      Margaret?&rdquo; and she, sitting there in the deep window looking on the
      square, longed to run to him, as usual also, and be lifted up in his
      strong arms; but she could not stir. Only when he found her did she rise
      up with a wistful look and a faint smile. &ldquo;Have you had a good day,
      child?&rdquo; And he kissed her. But her kiss was on her lips only, for her
      heart was heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner will be served as soon as you dress,&rdquo; she said. What a greeting
      was this! Who says that a woman cannot be as cruel as a man? The dinner
      was not very cheerful, though Margaret did her best not to appear
      constrained, and Henderson rattled on about the events of the day. It had
      been a deuce of a day, but it was coming right; he felt sure that the
      upper court would dissolve the injunction; the best counsel said so; and
      the criminal proceedings&mdash;&ldquo;Had there been criminal proceedings?&rdquo;
       asked Margaret, with a stricture at her heart&mdash;had broken down
      completely, hadn&rsquo;t a leg to stand on, never had, were only begun to bluff
      the company. It was a purely malicious prosecution. And Henderson did not
      think it necessary to tell Margaret that only Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s dexterity had
      spared both of them the experience of a night in the Ludlow Street jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Henderson&mdash;&ldquo;come into the library. I have something to
      tell you.&rdquo; He put his arm round her as they walked, and seating himself in
      his chair by his desk in front of the fire, he tried to draw Margaret to
      sit on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;ll sit here, so that I can see you,&rdquo; she said, composed and
      unyielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out his pocket-book, selected a slip of paper, and laid it on the
      table before him. &ldquo;There, that is a check for seven hundred dollars. I
      looked in the books. That is the interest for a year on the Fletcher
      bonds. Might as well make it an even year; it will be that soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say&mdash;&rdquo; asked Margaret, leaning forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; to brighten up the Christmas up there a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;that you are going to send that to Mrs. Fletcher?&rdquo; Margaret had
      risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; that wouldn&rsquo;t do. I cannot send it, nor know anything about it.
      It would raise the&mdash;well, it would&mdash;if the other bondholders
      knew anything about it. But you can change that for your check, and nobody
      the wiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Rodney!&rdquo; She was on his knee now. He was good, after all. Her head
      was on his shoulder, and she was crying a little. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so unhappy,
      so unhappy, all day! And I can send that?&rdquo; She sprang up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it this
      minute&mdash;I&rsquo;ll run and get my check-book!&rdquo; But before she reached the
      door she turned back, and came and stood by him and kissed him again and
      again, and tumbled up his hair, and looked at him. There is, after all,
      nothing in the world like a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time enough in the morning,&rdquo; said Henderson, detaining her. &ldquo;I want to
      tell you all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he told her was, in fact, the case as it had been presented by his
      lawyers, and it seemed a very large, a constitutional, kind of case. &ldquo;Of
      course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in the rivalry and competition of business somebody
      must go to the wall, and in a great scheme of development and
      reorganization of the transportation of a region as big as an empire some
      individual interests will suffer. You can&rsquo;t help these changes. I&rsquo;m sorry
      for some of them&mdash;very sorry; but nothing would ever be done if we
      waited to consider every little interest. And that the men who create
      these great works, and organize these schemes for the benefit of the whole
      public, shouldn&rsquo;t make anything by their superior enterprise and courage
      is all nonsense. The world is not made that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The explanation, I am bound to say, was one that half the world considers
      valid; it was one that squeezed through the courts. And when it was done,
      and the whole thing had blown over, who cared? There were some bondholders
      who said that it was rascally, that they had been boldly swindled. In the
      clubs, long after, you would hear it said that Hollowell and Henderson
      were awfully sharp, and hard to beat. It is a very bad business, said the
      Brandon parliament, and it just shows that the whole country is losing its
      moral sense, its capacity to judge what is right and what is wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not say that this explanation, the nature of which I have only
      indicated, would have satisfied the clear mind of Margaret a year or two
      before. But it was made by the man she loved, the man who had brought her
      out into a world that was full of sunlight and prosperity and satisfied
      desire; and more and more, day by day, she saw the world through his eyes,
      and accepted his estimate of the motives of people&mdash;and a low
      estimate I fear it was. Who would not be rich if he could? Do you mean to
      tell me that a man who is getting fat dividends out of a stock does not
      regard more leniently the manner in which that stock is manipulated than
      one who does not own any of it? I dare say, if Carmen had heard that
      explanation, and seen Margaret&rsquo;s tearful, happy acceptance of it, she
      would have shaken her pretty head and said, &ldquo;They are getting too worldly
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the letter was despatched to Miss Forsythe, enclosing the
      check for Mrs. Fletcher&mdash;a joyful note, full of affection. &ldquo;We cannot
      come,&rdquo; Margaret wrote. &ldquo;My husband cannot leave, and he does not want to
      spare me&rdquo;&mdash;the little hypocrite! he had told her that she could
      easily go for a day &ldquo;but we shall think of you dear ones all day, and I do
      hope that now there will not be the least cloud on your Christmas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seems a great pity, in view of the scientific organization of society,
      that there are so many sensibilities unclassified and unprovided for in
      the otherwise perfect machinery. Why should the beggar to whom you toss a
      silver dollar from your carriage feel a little grudge against you? Perhaps
      he wouldn&rsquo;t like to earn the dollar, but if it had been accompanied by a
      word of sympathy, his sensibility might have been soothed by your
      recognition of human partnership in the goods of this world. People not
      paupers are all eager to take what is theirs of right; but anything in the
      semblance of charity is a bitter pill to swallow until self-respect is a
      little broken down. Probably the resentment lies in the recognition of the
      truth that it is much easier to be charitable than to be just. If Margaret
      had seen the effect produced by her letter she might have thought of this;
      she might have gone further, and reflected upon what would have been her
      own state of mind two years earlier if she had received such a letter.
      Miss Forsythe read it with a very heavy heart. She hesitated about showing
      it to Mrs. Fletcher, and when she did, and gave her the check, it was with
      a sense of shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The insolence of the thing!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Fletcher, as soon as she
      comprehended it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not insolence,&rdquo; pleaded Miss Forsythe, softly; &ldquo;it is out of the kindness
      of her heart. She would be dreadfully wounded to know that you took it
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fletcher, hotly, &ldquo;I like that kind of sensibility. Does
      she think I have no feeling? Does she think I would take from her as a
      charity what her husband knows is mine by right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps her husband&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Fletcher interrupted. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he send it, then? why didn&rsquo;t
      the company send it? They owe it. I&rsquo;m not a pauper. And all the other
      bondholders who need the money as much as I do! I&rsquo;m not saying that if the
      company sent it I should refuse it because the others had been treated
      unjustly; but to take it as a favor, like a beggar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you cannot take it from Margaret,&rdquo; said Miss Forsythe sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dreadful it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fletcher would have shared her last crust with Miss Forsythe, and if
      her own fortune were absolutely lost, she would not hesitate to accept the
      shelter of her present home, using her energies to add to their limited
      income, serving and being served in all love and trust. But this is
      different from taking a bounty from the rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      The check had to go back. Even my wife, who saw no insolence in Margaret&rsquo;s
      attempt, applauded Mrs. Fletcher&rsquo;s spirit. She told Miss Forsythe that if
      things did not mend they might get a few little pupils for Mrs. Fletcher
      from the neighborhood, and Miss Forsythe knew that she was thinking that
      her own boy might have been one of them if he had lived. Mr. Morgan was a
      little satirical, as usual. He thought it would be a pity to check
      Margaret&rsquo;s growing notion that there was no wrong that money could not
      heal a remark that my wife thought unjust to the girl. Mrs. Fletcher was
      for re-enclosing the check without a word of comment, but that Miss
      Forsythe would not do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Margaret,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;I know the kindness of heart that moved
      you to do this, and I love you more than ever, and am crying as I think of
      it. But you must see yourself, when you reflect, that Mrs. Fletcher could
      not take this from you. Her self-respect would not permit it. Somebody has
      done a great wrong, and only those who have done it can undo it. I don&rsquo;t
      know much about such things, my dear, and I don&rsquo;t believe all that the
      newspapers have been saying, but there would be no need for charity if
      there had not been dishonesty somewhere. I cannot help thinking that. We
      do not blame you. And you must not take it to heart that I am compelled to
      send this back. I understand why you sent it, and you must try to
      understand why it cannot be kept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was more of this sort in the letter. It was full of a kind of
      sorrowful yearning, as if there was fear that Margaret&rsquo;s love were
      slipping away and all the old relations were being broken up, but yet it
      had in it a certain moral condemnation that the New England spinster could
      not conceal. Softened as it was by affectionate words, and all the loving
      messages of the season, it was like a slap in the face to Margaret. She
      read it in the first place with intense mortification, and then with
      indignation. This was the way her loving spirit was flung back upon her!
      They did not blame her! They blamed her husband, then. They condemned him.
      It was his generosity that was spurned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there a particular moment when we choose our path in life, when we take
      the right or the left? At this instant, when Margaret arose with the
      crumpled letter in her hand, and marched towards her husband&rsquo;s library,
      did she choose, or had she been choosing for the two years past, and was
      this only a publication of her election? Why had she secretly been a
      little relieved from restraint when her Brandon visit ended in the spring?
      They were against her husband; they disapproved of him, that was clear.
      Was it not a wife&rsquo;s duty to stand by her husband? She was indignant with
      the Brandon scrupulousness; it chafed her.. Was this simply because she
      loved her husband, or was this indignation a little due also to her liking
      for the world which so fell in with her inclinations? The motives in life
      are so mixed that it seems impossible wholly to condemn or wholly to
      approve. If Margaret&rsquo;s destiny had been united with such a man as John
      Lyon, what would have been her discernment in such a case as this? It is
      such a pity that for most people there is only one chance in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid the letter and the check upon her husband&rsquo;s desk. He read it with
      a slight frown, which changed to a smile of amusement as he looked up and
      saw Margaret&rsquo;s excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a miss-go. Those folks up there are too good for this world.
      You&rsquo;d better send it to the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see that they say they do not blame me,&rdquo; Margaret said, with
      warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can stand it. People usually don&rsquo;t try to hurt my feelings that
      way. Don&rsquo;t mind it, child. They will come to their senses, and see what
      nonsense it all is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was nonsense. And how generous and kind at heart her husband was!
      In his skillful making little of it she was very much comforted, and at
      the same time drawn into more perfect sympathy with him. She was glad she
      was not going to Brandon for Christmas; she would not submit herself to
      its censorship. The note of acknowledgment she wrote to her aunt was short
      and almost formal. She was very sorry they looked at the matter in that
      way. She thought she was doing right, and they might blame her or not, but
      her aunt would see that she could not permit any distinction to be set up
      between her and her husband, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this little note a severance of her present from her old life? I do
      not suppose she regarded it so. If she had fully realized that it was a
      step in that direction, would she have penned it with so little regret as
      she felt? Or did she think that circumstances and not her own choice were
      responsible for her state of feeling? She was mortified, as has been said,
      but she wrote with more indignation than pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year ago Carmen would have been the last person to whom Margaret would
      have spoken about a family affair of this kind. Nor would she have done so
      now, notwithstanding the intimacy established at Newport, if Carmen had
      not happened in that day, when Margaret was still hurt and excited, and
      skillfully and most sympathetically extracted from her the cause of the
      mood she found her in. But even with all these allowances, that Margaret
      should confide such a matter to Carmen was the most startling sign of the
      change that had taken place in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said this wise person, after she had wormed out the whole story,
      and expressed her profound sympathy, and then fallen into an attitude of
      deep reflection&mdash;&ldquo;well, I wish I could cast my bread upon the waters
      in that way. What are you going to do with the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent it to the hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What extravagance! And did you tell your aunt that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? I couldn&rsquo;t have resisted such a righteous chance of making her
      feel bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to make her feel bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little? You will never convince people that you are unworldly this
      way. Even Uncle Jerry wouldn&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and Uncle Jerry are very much alike,&rdquo; cried Margaret, laughing in
      spite of herself&mdash;&ldquo;both of you as bad as you can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear, we don&rsquo;t pretend, do we?&rdquo; asked Carmen, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some of us at Brandon, Margaret&rsquo;s letter was scarcely a surprise,
      though it emphasized a divergence we had been conscious of. But with Miss
      Forsythe it was far otherwise. The coolness of Margaret&rsquo;s tone filled her
      with alarm; it was the premonition of a future which she did not dare to
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a passage in the letter which she did not show; not that it was
      unfeeling, she told my wife afterwards, but that it exhibited a
      worldly-mindedness that she could not have conceived of in Margaret. She
      could bear separation from the girl on whom she had bestowed her tenderest
      affection, that she had schooled herself to expect upon her marriage&mdash;that,
      indeed, was only a part of her life of willing self-sacrifice&mdash;their
      paths must lie apart, and she could hope to see little of her. But what
      she could not bear was the separation in spirit, the wrenching apart of
      sympathy, the loss of her heart, and the thought of her going farther and
      farther away into that world whose cynical and materialistic view of life
      made her shudder. I think there are few tragedies in life comparable to
      this to a sensitive, trusting soul&mdash;not death itself, with its
      gracious healing and oblivion and pathos. Family quarrels have something
      sustaining in them, something of a sense of wrong and even indignation to
      keep up the spirits. There was no family quarrel here, no indignation,
      just simple, helpless grief and sense of loss. In one sense it seemed to
      the gentle spinster that her own life was ended, she had lived so in this
      girl&mdash;ever since she came to her a child, in long curls and short
      frocks, the sweetest, most trustful, mischievous, affectionate thing.
      These two then never had had any secrets, never any pleasure, never any
      griefs they did not share. She had seen the child&rsquo;s mind unfold, the
      girl&rsquo;s grace and intelligence, the woman&rsquo;s character. Oh, Margaret, she
      cried, to herself, if you only knew what you are to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret&rsquo;s little chamber in the cottage was always kept ready for her,
      much in the condition she had left it. She might come back at any time,
      and be a girl again. Here were many of the things which she had cherished;
      indeed everything in the room spoke of the simple days of her maidenhood.
      It was here that Miss Forsythe sat in her loneliness the morning after she
      received the letter, by the window with the muslin curtain, looking out
      through the shrubbery to the blue hills. She must be here; she could stay
      nowhere else in the house, for here the little Margaret came back to her.
      Ah, and when she turned, would she hear the quick steps and see the
      smiling face, and would she put back the tangled hair and lift her up and
      kiss her? There in that closet still hung articles of her clothing-dresses
      that had been laid aside when she became a woman&mdash;kept with the
      sacred sentiment of New England thrift. How each one, as Miss Forsythe
      took them down, recalled the girl! In the inner closet was a pile of paper
      boxes. I do not know what impulse it was that led the heavy-hearted woman
      to take them down one by one, and indulge her grief in the memories
      enshrined in them. In one was a little bonnet, a spring bonnet; Margaret
      had worn it on the Easter Sunday when she took her first communion. The
      little thing was out of fashion now; the ribbons were all faded, but the
      spray of moss rose-buds on the side was almost as fresh as ever. How well
      she remembered it, and the girl&rsquo;s delight in the nodding roses!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Fletcher had called again and again, with no response, and
      finally opened the door and peeped in, there the spinster sat by the
      window, the pitiful little bonnet in her hand, and the tears rolling down
      her cheeks. God help her!

      The medical faculty are of the opinion that a sprain is often worse than a
      broken limb; a purely scientific, view of the matter, in which the patient
      usually does not coincide. Well-bred people shrink from the vulgarity of
      violence, and avoid the publicity of any open rupture in domestic and
      social relations. And yet, perhaps, a lively quarrel would be less
      lamentable than the withering away of friendship while appearances are
      kept up. Nothing, indeed, is more pitiable than the gradual drifting apart
      of people who have been dear to each other&mdash;a severance produced by
      change of views and of principle, and the substitution of indifference for
      sympathy. This disintegration is certain to take the spring and taste out
      of life, and commonly to habituate one to a lower view of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no rupture between the Hendersons and the Brandon circle, but
      there was little intercourse of the kind that had existed before. There
      was with us a profound sense of loss and sorrow, due partly to the growing
      knowledge, not pleasing to our vanity, that Margaret could get on very
      well without us, that we were not necessary to her life. Miss Forsythe
      recovered promptly her cheerful serenity, but not the elasticity of hope;
      she was irretrievably hurt; it was as if life was now to be endured. That
      Margaret herself was apparently unconscious of this, and that it did not
      affect much her own enjoyment, made it the harder to bear. The absolute
      truth probably was that she regretted it, and had moments of sentimental
      unhappiness; but there is great compensation for such loss in the feeling
      of freedom to pursue a career that is more and more agreeable. And I had
      to confess, when occasionally I saw Margaret during that winter, that she
      did not need us. Why should she? Did not the city offer her everything
      that she desired? And where in the world are beauty, and gayety with a
      touch of daring, and a magnificent establishment better appreciated? I do
      not know what criterion newspaper notoriety is of social prestige, but
      Mrs. Rodney Henderson&rsquo;s movements were as faithfully chronicled as if she
      had been a visiting princess or an actress of eccentric proclivities. Her
      name appeared as patroness of all the charities, the balls, the soirees,
      musical and literary, and if it did not appear in a list of the persons at
      any entertainment, one might suspect that the affair lacked the cachet of
      the best society. I suppose the final test of one&rsquo;s importance is to have
      all the details of one&rsquo;s wardrobe spread before the public. Judged by
      this, Margaret&rsquo;s career in New York was phenomenal. Even our interested
      household could not follow her in all the changing splendor of her
      raiment. In time even Miss Forsythe ceased to read all these details, but
      she cut them out, deposited them with other relics in a sort of mortuary
      box of the child and the maiden. I used to wonder if, in the Brandon
      attitude of mind at this period, there were not just a little envy of such
      unclouded prosperity. It is so much easier to forgive a failure than a
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring the Hendersons went abroad. The resolution to go may have
      been sudden, for Margaret wrote of it briefly, and had not time to run up
      and say good-by. The newspapers said that the trip was taken on account of
      Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s health; that it was because Henderson needed rest from
      overwork; that he found it convenient to be away for a time, pending the
      settlement of certain complications. There were ugly stories afloat, but
      they were put in so many forms, and followed by so many different sorts of
      denial, and so much importance was attached to every word Henderson
      uttered, and every step he took, that the general impression of his
      far-reaching sagacity and Napoleonic command of fortune was immensely
      raised. Nothing is more significant of our progress than the good-humored
      deference of the world to this sort of success. It is said that the
      attraction of gravitation lessens according to the distance from the
      earth, and there seems to be a region of aerial freedom, if one can attain
      it, where the moral forces cease to be operative.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained in Europe a year, although Mr. Henderson in the interim made
      two or three hasty trips to this country, always, so far as it was made
      public, upon errands of great importance, and in connection with names of
      well-known foreign capitalists and enterprises of dignity. Margaret wrote
      seldom, but always with evident enjoyment of her experiences, which were
      mainly social, for wherever they went they commanded the consideration
      that is accorded to fortune. What most impressed me in these hasty notes
      was that the woman was so little interested in the persons and places
      which in the old days she expressed such a lively desire to see. If she
      saw them at all, it was from a different point of view than that she
      formerly had. She did indeed express her admiration of some charming
      literary friends of ours in London, to whom I had written to call on her&mdash;people
      in very moderate circumstances, I am ashamed to say&mdash;but she had not
      time to see much of them. She and her husband had spent a couple of days
      at Chisholm&mdash;delightful days. Of the earl she had literally nothing
      to say, except that he was very kind, and that his family received them
      with the most engaging and simple cordiality. &ldquo;It makes me laugh,&rdquo; she
      wrote from Chisholm, &ldquo;when I think what we considered fine at Lenox and
      Newport. I&rsquo;ve got some ideas for our new house.&rdquo; A note came from &ldquo;John
      Lyon&rdquo; to Miss Forsythe, expressing the great pleasure it was to return,
      even in so poor a way, the hospitality he had received at Brandon. I did
      not see it, but Miss Forsythe said it was a sad little note.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris Margaret was ill&mdash;very ill; and this misfortune caused for a
      time a revival of all the old affection, in sympathy with a disappointment
      which awoke in our womankind all the tenderness of their natures. She was
      indeed a little delicate for some time, but all our apprehensions were
      relieved by the reports from Rome of a succession of gayeties little
      interfered with by archaeological studies. They returned in June. Of the
      year abroad there was nothing to chronicle, and there would be nothing to
      note except that when Margaret passed a day with us on her return, we
      felt, as never before, that our interests in life were more and more
      divergent.

      How could it be otherwise? There were so many topics of conversation that
      we had to avoid. Even light remarks on current news, comments that we used
      to make freely on the conduct of conspicuous persons, now carried
      condemnation that took a personal color. The doubtful means of making
      money, the pace of fashionable life, the wasteful prodigality of the time,
      we instinctively shrank from speaking of before Margaret. Perhaps we did
      her injustice. She was never more gracious, never more anxious to please.
      I fancied that there was at times something pathetic in her wistful desire
      for our affection and esteem. She was always a generous girl, and I have
      no doubt she felt repelled at the quiet rejection of her well-meant
      efforts to play the Lady Bountiful. There were moments during her brief
      visit when her face was very sad, but no doubt her predominant feeling
      escaped her in regard to the criticism quoted from somebody on Jerry
      Hollowell&rsquo;s methods and motives. &ldquo;People are becoming very
      self-righteous,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife said to me that she was reminded of the gentle observation of
      Carmen Eschelle, &ldquo;The people I cannot stand are those who pretend they are
      not wicked.&rdquo; If one does not believe in anybody his cynicism has usually a
      quality of contemptuous bitterness in it. One brought up as Margaret had
      been could not very well come to her present view of life without a touch
      of this quality, but her disposition was so lovely&mdash;perhaps there is
      no moral quality in a good temper&mdash;that change of principle could not
      much affect it. And then she was never more winning; perhaps her beauty
      had taken on a more refined quality from her illness abroad; perhaps it
      was that indefinable knowledge of the world, which is recognized as well
      in dress as in manner, which increased her attractiveness. This was quite
      apart from the fact that she was not so sympathetically companionable to
      us as she once was, and it was this very attractiveness of the worldly
      sort, I fancied, that pained her aunt, and marked the separateness of
      their sympathies.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could it be otherwise than that our interests should diverge? It was a
      very busy summer with the Hendersons. They were planning the New York
      house, which had been one of the objects of Henderson&rsquo;s early ambition.
      The sea-air had been prescribed for Margaret, and Henderson had built a
      steam-yacht, the equipment and furnishing of which had been a prolific
      newspaper topic. It was greatly admired by yachtsmen for the beauty of its
      lines and its speed, and pages were written about its sumptuous and
      comfortable interior. I never saw it, having little faith in the comfort
      of any structure that is not immovably reposeful, but from the
      descriptions it was a boudoir afloat. In it short voyages were made during
      the summer all along the coast from New York to Maine, and the arrival and
      departure of the Henderson yacht was one of the telegraphic items we
      always looked for. Carmen Eschelle was usually of the party on board,
      sometimes the Misses Arbuser; it was always a gay company, and in whatever
      harbor it dropped anchor there was a new impetus given to the somewhat
      languid pleasure of the summer season. We read of the dinners and lunches
      on board, the entertainments where there were wine and dancing and
      moonlight, and all that. I always thought of it as a fairy sort of ship,
      sailing on summer seas, freighted with youth and beauty, and carrying
      pleasure and good-fortune wherever it went. What more pleasing spectacle
      than this in a world that has such a bad name for want and misery?
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was master of the situation. The sudden accumulation of millions
      of money is a mystery to most people. If Henderson had been asked about it
      he would have said that he had not a dollar which he had not earned by
      hard work. None worked harder. If simple industry is a virtue, he would
      have been an example for Sunday-school children. The object of life being
      to make money, he would have been a perfect example. What an inspiration,
      indeed, for all poor boys were the names of Hollowell and Henderson, which
      were as familiar as the name of the President! There was much speculation
      as to the amount of Henderson&rsquo;s fortune, and many wild estimates of it,
      but by common consent he was one of the three or four great capitalists.
      The gauge of this was his power, and the amounts he could command in an
      emergency. There was a mystery in the very fact that the amount he could
      command was unknown. I have said that his accumulation was sudden; it was
      probably so only in appearance. For a dozen years, by operations, various,
      secret, untiring, he had been laying the foundations for his success, and
      in the maturing of his schemes it became apparent how vast his
      transactions had been. For years he had been known as a rising man, and
      suddenly he became an important man. The telegraph, the newspapers,
      chronicled his every movement; whatever he said was construed like a
      Delphic oracle. The smile or the frown of Jay Hawker himself had not a
      greater effect upon the market. The Southwest operation, which made so
      much noise in the courts, was merely an incident. In the lives of many
      successful men there are such incidents, which they do not care to have
      inquired into, turning-points that one slides over in the subsequent
      gilded biography, or, as it is called, the nickel-plated biography. The
      uncomfortable A. and B. bondholders had been settled with and silenced,
      after a fashion. In the end, Mrs. Fletcher had received from the company
      nearly the full amount of her investment. I always thought this was due to
      Margaret, but I made no inquiries. There were many people who had no
      confidence in Henderson, but generally his popularity was not much
      affected, and whatever was said of him in private, his social position was
      almost as unchallenged as his financial. It was a great point in his favor
      that he was very generous to his family and his friends, and his public
      charities began to be talked of. Nothing could have been more admirable
      than a paper which appeared about this time in one of the leading
      magazines, written by a great capitalist during a strike in his &ldquo;system,&rdquo;
       off the uses of wealth and the responsibilities of rich men. It amused
      Henderson and Uncle Jerry, and Margaret sent it, marked, to her aunt.
      Uncle Jerry said it was very timely, for at the moment there was a report
      that Hollowell and Henderson had obtained possession of one of the great
      steamship lines in connection with their trans-continental system. I
      thought at the time that I should like to have heard Carmen&rsquo;s comments on
      the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The continued friendly alliance of Rodney Henderson and Jerry Hollowell
      was a marvel to the public, which expected to read any morning that the
      one had sold out the other, or unloaded in a sly deal. The Stock Exchange
      couldn&rsquo;t understand it; it was so against all experience that it was
      considered something outside of human nature. But the explanation was
      simple enough. The two kept a sharp eye on each other, and, as Uncle Jerry
      would say, never dropped a stitch; but the simple fact was that they were
      necessary to each other, and there had been no opportunity when the one
      could handsomely swallow the other. So it was beautiful to see their
      accord, and the familiar understanding between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in Henderson&rsquo;s office&mdash;it was at the time they were arranging
      the steamship &ldquo;scoop&rdquo; while they were waiting for the drafting of some
      papers, Uncle Jerry suddenly asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, old man, what&rsquo;s all this about a quarter of a million for a
      colored college down South?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s affair. They say it&rsquo;s the most magnificent
      college building south of Washington. It&rsquo;s big enough. I&rsquo;ve seen the plan
      of it. Henderson Hall, they are going to call it. I suggested Margaret
      Henderson Hall, but she wouldn&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One end of it is scientific, geological, chemical, electric, biological,
      and all that; and the other end is theological. Miss Eschelle says it&rsquo;s to
      reconcile science and religion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a daisy-that girl. Seems to me, though, that you are educating the
      colored brother all on top. I suppose, however, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been so
      philanthropic to build a hall for a white college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Henderson laughed. &ldquo;You keep your eye on the religious sentiment of the
      North, Uncle Jerry. I told Mrs. Henderson that we had gone long on the
      colored brother a good while. She said this was nothing. We could endow a
      Henderson University by-and-by in the Southwest, white as alabaster, and I
      suppose we shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, probably we&rsquo;ve got to do something in that region to keep &lsquo;em quiet.
      The public is a curious fish. It wants plenty of bait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And something to talk about,&rdquo; continued Henderson. &ldquo;We are going down
      next week to dedicate Henderson Hall. I couldn&rsquo;t get out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will pay,&rdquo; said Uncle Jerry, as he turned again to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trip was made in Henderson&rsquo;s private car; in fact, in a special train,
      vestibuled; a neat baggage car with library and reading-room in one end, a
      dining-room car, a private car for invited guests, and his own car&mdash;a
      luxurious structure, with drawing-room, sleeping-room, bath-room, and
      office for his telegrapher and type-writer. The whole was a most
      commodious house of one story on wheels. The cost of it would have built
      and furnished an industrial school and workshop for a hundred negroes; but
      this train was, I dare say, a much more inspiring example of what they
      might attain by the higher education. There were half a dozen in the party
      besides the Hendersons&mdash;Carmen, of course; Mr. Ponsonby, the English
      attache; and Mrs. Laflamme, to matronize three New York young ladies.
      Margaret and Carmen had never been so far South before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not agreeable to have sweet charity silver shod? This sumptuous
      special train caused as much comment as the errand on which it went. Its
      coming was telegraphed from station to station, and crowds everywhere
      collected to see it. Brisk reporters boarded it; the newspapers devoted
      columns to descriptions of it; editorials glorified it as a signal example
      of the progress of the great republic, or moralized on it as a sign of the
      luxurious decadence of morals; pointing to Carthage and Rome and
      Alexandria in withering sarcasm that made those places sink into
      insignificance as corrupters of the world. There were covert allusions to
      Cleopatra ensconced in the silken hangings of the boudoir car, and one
      reporter went so far as to refer to the luxury of Capua and Baiae, to
      their disparagement. All this, however, was felt to add to the glory of
      the republic, and it all increased the importance of Henderson. To hear
      the exclamations, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s he!&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Henderson!&rdquo; was to
      Margaret in some degree a realization of her ambition; and Carmen declared
      that it was for her a sweet thought to be identified with Cleopatra.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Catachoobee University had its splendid new building&mdash;as great
      a contrast to the shanties from which its pupils came as is the Capitol at
      Washington to the huts of a third of its population. If the reader is
      curious he may read in the local newspapers of the time glowing accounts
      of its &ldquo;inaugural dedication&rdquo;; but universities are so common in this
      country that it has become a little wearisome to read of ceremonies of
      this sort. Mr. Henderson made a modest reply to the barefaced eulogy on
      himself, which the president pronounced in the presence of six hundred
      young men and women of various colors and invited guests&mdash;a eulogy
      which no one more thoroughly enjoyed than Carmen. I am sorry to say that
      she refused to take the affair seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt for you, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo;; she said, after the exercises were over.
      &ldquo;I blushed for you. I almost felt ashamed, after all the president said,
      that you had given so little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem, Miss Eschelle,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Ponsonby, &ldquo;to be enthusiastic
      about the education and elevation of the colored people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am; I quite share Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s feeling about it. I&rsquo;m for the
      elevation of everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a capital chance for you,&rdquo; said Henderson; &ldquo;the university wants
      some scholarships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve half a mind to found one&mdash;the Eschelle Scholarship of
      Washing and Clear-starching. You ought to have seen my clothes that came
      back to the car. Probably they were not done by your students. The things
      looked as if they had been dragged through the Cat-a-what-do-you-call-it
      River, and ironed with a pine chip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you do them any better, with all your cultivation?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could, if I was obliged to. But I couldn&rsquo;t get through that
      university, with all its ologies and laboratories and Greek and queer
      bottles and machines. You have neglected my education, Mr. Henderson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not too late to begin now; you might see if you could pass the
      examination here. It is part of our plan gradually to elevate the whites,&rdquo;
       said Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; and did you see that some of the scholars had red hair and
      blue eyes, quite in the present style? And how nice the girls looked,&rdquo; she
      rattled on; &ldquo;and what a lot of intelligent faces, and how they kindled up
      when the president talked about the children of Israel in the wilderness
      forty years, and Caesar crossing the Rubicon! And you, sir&rdquo;&mdash;she
      turned to the Englishman&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard, were against all this
      emancipation during the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Ponsonby, &ldquo;we never were against emancipation,
      and wanted the best side to win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a mighty queer way of showing it, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, honestly, Miss Eschelle, do you think the negroes are any better
      off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask them. My opinion is that everybody should do what he
      likes in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what are you girding Mr. Henderson for about his university?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because these philanthropists, like Mr. Henderson and Uncle Jerry
      Hollowell, are all building on top; putting on the frosting before the
      cake rises.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you found out, Mr. Ponsonby,&rdquo; Margaret interrupted, &ldquo;that if
      there were eight sides to a question, Miss Eschelle would be on every one
      of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right, too. There are eight sides to every question, and generally
      more. I think the negro question has a hundred. But there is only one side
      to Henderson Hall. It is a noble institution. I like to think about it,
      and Uncle Caesar Hollowell crossing the Rubicon in his theological
      seminary. It is all so beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a bad child,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;We should have left you at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not bad, dear; only confused with such a lot of good deeds in a
      naughty world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That this junketing party was deeply interested in the cause of education
      for whites or blacks, no one would have gathered from the conversation.
      Margaret felt that Carmen had exactly hit the motives of this sort of
      philanthropy, and she was both amused and provoked by the girl&rsquo;s mockery.
      By force of old habit she defended, as well she might, these schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have a high standard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You cannot have good lower
      schools without good higher schools. And these colleges, which you think
      above the colored people, will stimulate them and gradually raise the
      whole mass. You cannot do anything until you educate teachers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have always heard,&rdquo; replied the incorrigible. &ldquo;I have always been a
      philanthropist about the negro till I came down here, and I intend to be
      again when I go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Laflamme was not a very eager apostle either, and the young ladies
      devoted themselves to the picturesque aspects of the population, without
      any concern for the moral problems. They all declared that they liked the
      negro. But Margaret was not to be moved from her good-humor by any amount
      of badgering. She liked Henderson Hall; she was proud of the consideration
      it brought her husband; she had a comfortable sense of doing something
      that was demanded by her opportunity. It is so difficult to analyze
      motives, and in Margaret&rsquo;s case so hard to define the change that had
      taken place in her. That her heart was not enlisted in this affair, as it
      would have been a few years before, she herself knew. Insensibly she had
      come to look at the world, at men and women, through her husband&rsquo;s eyes,
      to take the worldly view, which is not inconsistent with much good feeling
      and easy-going charity. She also felt the necessity&mdash;a necessity
      totally unknown to such a nature as Carmen&rsquo;s&mdash;of making compensation,
      of compounding for her pleasures. Gradually she was learning to play her
      husband&rsquo;s game in life, and to see no harm in it. What, then, is this
      thing we call conscience? Is it made of India-rubber? I once knew a clever
      Southern woman, who said that New England women seemed to her all
      conscience&mdash;Southern women all soul and impulse. If it were possible
      to generalize in this way, we might say that Carmen had neither conscience
      nor soul, simply very clever reason. Uncle Jerry had no more conscience
      than Carmen, but he had a great deal of natural affection. Henderson, with
      an abundance of good-nature, was simply a man of his time, troubled with
      no scruples that stood in the way of his success. Margaret, with a finer
      nature than either of them, stifling her scruples in an atmosphere of
      worldly-mindedness, was likely to go further than either of them. Even
      such a worldling as Carmen understood this. &ldquo;I do things,&rdquo; she said to
      Mrs. Laflamme&mdash;she made anybody her confidant when the fit was on her&mdash;&ldquo;I
      do things because I don&rsquo;t care. Mrs. Henderson does the same, but she does
      care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret would be a sadder woman, but not a better woman, when the time
      came that she did not care. She had come to the point of accepting
      Henderson&rsquo;s methods of overreaching the world, and was tempering the
      result with private liberality. Those were hypocrites who criticised him;
      those were envious who disparaged him; the sufficient ethics of the world
      she lived in was to be successful and be agreeable. And it is difficult to
      condemn a person who goes with the general opinion of his generation.
      Carmen was under no illusions about Henderson, or the methods and manners
      of which she was a part. &ldquo;Why pretend?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are all bad
      together, and I like it. Uncle Jerry is the easiest person to get on
      with.&rdquo; I remember a delightful, wicked old baroness whom I met in my youth
      stranded in Geneva on short allowance&mdash;European resorts are full of
      such characters. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t I renege? Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t men cheat at cards? It&rsquo;s all in the game. Don&rsquo;t we all know we
      are trying to deceive each other and get the best of each other? I stopped
      pretending after Waterloo. Fighting for the peace of Europe! Bah! We are
      all fighting for what we can get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the Catachoobee Henderson Hall was dedicated, and Mr. Henderson got
      great credit out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a noble deed, Mr. Henderson,&rdquo; Carmen remarked, when they were at
      dinner on the car the day of their departure. &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;in an aside to
      her host&mdash;&ldquo;I advise the lambs in Wall Street to look alive at your
      next deal.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      We can get used to anything. Morgan says that even the New England summer
      is endurable when you learn to dress warmly enough. We come to endure pain
      and loss with equanimity; one thing and another drops out of our
      lives-youth, for instance, and sometimes enthusiasm&mdash;and still we go
      on with a good degree of enjoyment. I do not say that Miss Forsythe was
      quite the same, or that a certain zest of life and spring had not gone out
      of the little Brandon neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the months and the years went by we saw less and less of Margaret&mdash;less
      and less, that is, in the old way. Her rare visits were perfunctory, and
      gave little satisfaction to any of us; not that she was ungracious or
      unkindly, but simply because the things we valued in life were not the
      same. There was no doubt that any of us were welcome at the Hendersons&rsquo; 
      when they were in the city, genuinely, though in an exterior way, but
      gradually we almost ceased to keep up an intercourse which was a little
      effort on both sides. Miss Forsythe came back from her infrequent city
      visits weary and sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Margaret content? I suppose so. She was gay; she was admired; she was
      always on view in that semi-public world in which Henderson moved; she
      attained a newspaper notoriety which many people envied. If she journeyed
      anywhere, if she tarried anywhere, if she had a slight illness, the fact
      was a matter of public concern. We knew where she worshiped; we knew the
      houses she frequented, the charities she patronized, the fetes she
      adorned, every new costume that her wearing made the fashion. Was she
      content? She could perhaps express no desire that an attempt was not made
      to gratify it. But it seems impossible to get enough things enough money,
      enough pleasure. They had a magnificent place in Newport; it was not large
      enough; they were always adding to it&mdash;awning, a ballroom, some
      architectural whim or another. Margaret had a fancy for a cottage at Bar
      Harbor, but they rarely went there. They had an interest in Tuxedo; they
      belonged to an exclusive club on Jekyl Island. They passed one winter
      yachting among the islands in the eastern Mediterranean; a part of another
      sailing from one tropical paradise to another in the West Indies. If there
      was anything that money could not obtain, it seemed to be a place where
      they could rest in serene peace with themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to wonder whether Margaret was satisfied with her husband&rsquo;s
      reputation. Perhaps she mistook the newspaper homage, the notoriety, for
      public respect. She saw his influence and his power. She saw that he was
      feared, and of course hated, by some&mdash;the unsuccessful&mdash;but she
      saw the terms he was on with his intimates, due to the fact that everybody
      admitted that whatever Henderson was in &ldquo;a deal,&rdquo; privately he was a
      deuced good fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this an ideal married life? Henderson&rsquo;s selfishness was fully
      developed, and I could see that he was growing more and more hard. Would
      Margaret not have felt it, if she also had not been growing hard, and
      accustomed to regard the world in his unbelieving way? No, there was
      sharpness occasionally between them, tiffs and disagreements. He was a
      great deal away from home, and she plunged into a life of her own, which
      had all the external signs of enjoyment. I doubt if he was ever very
      selfish where she was concerned, and love can forgive almost any conduct
      where there is personal indulgence. I had a glimpse of the real state of
      things in a roundabout way. Henderson loved his wife and was proud of her,
      and he was not unkind, but he might have been a brute and tied her up to
      the bedpost, and she never would have shown by the least sign to the world
      that she was not the most happy of wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Earl of Chisholm was in this country it was four years after
      Margaret&rsquo;s marriage&mdash;we naturally saw a great deal of him. The young
      fellow whom we liked so much had become a man, with a graver demeanor, and
      I thought a trace of permanent sadness in his face; perhaps it was only
      the responsibility of his position, or, as Morgan said, the modern weight
      that must press upon an earl who is conscientious. He was still unmarried.
      The friendship between him and Miss Forsythe, which had been kept alive by
      occasional correspondence, became more cordial and confidential. In New
      York he had seen much of Margaret, not at all to his peace of mind in many
      ways, though the generous fellow would have been less hurt if he had not
      estimated at its real value the life she was leading. It did not need
      Margaret&rsquo;s introduction for the earl to be sought for by the novelty and
      pleasure loving society of the city; but he got, as he confessed, small
      satisfaction out of the whirl of it, although we knew that he met Mrs.
      Henderson everywhere, and in a manner assisted in her social triumphs. But
      he renewed his acquaintance with Miss Eschelle, and it was the prattle of
      this ingenuous creature that made him more heavy-hearted than anything
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice it is of you, Mr. Lyon&mdash;may I call you so, to bring back
      the old relations?&mdash;to come here and revive the memory of the dear
      old days when we were all innocent and happy! Dear me, I used to think I
      could patronize that little country girl from Brandon! I was so worldly&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you remember?&mdash;and she was so good. And now she is such a splendid
      woman, it is difficult for the rest of us to keep pace with her. The nerve
      she has, and the things she will do! I just envy her. I sometimes think
      she will drive me into a convent. And don&rsquo;t you think she is more
      beautiful than ever? Of course her face is a little careworn, but nobody
      makes up as she does; she was just ravishing the other night. Do you know,
      I think she takes her husband too seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust she is happy,&rdquo; the earl had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t she be?&rdquo; Carmen asked in return. &ldquo;She has everything she
      wants. They both have a little temper; life would be flat without that;
      she is a little irritable sometimes; she didn&rsquo;t use to be; and when they
      don&rsquo;t agree they let each other alone for a little. I think she is as
      happy as anybody can be who is married. Now you are shocked! Well, I don&rsquo;t
      know any one who is more in love than she is, and that may be happiness.
      She is becoming exactly like Mr. Henderson. You couldn&rsquo;t ask anything more
      than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Margaret were really happy, the earl told Miss Forsythe, he was glad,
      but it was scarcely the career he would have thought would have suited
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the great house was approaching completion. Henderson&rsquo;s palace,
      in the upper part of the city, had long been a topic for the
      correspondents of the country press. It occupied half a square. Many
      critics were discontented with it because it did not occupy the whole
      square. Everybody was interested in having it the finest residence on the
      continent. Why didn&rsquo;t Henderson take the whole block of ground, build his
      palace on three sides, with the offices and stables on the fourth, throw a
      glass roof over the vast interior court, plant it with tropical trees and
      plants, adorn it with flower-beds and fountains, and make a veritable
      winter-garden, giving the inhabitants a temperate climate all the cold
      months? He might easily have summer in the centre of the city from
      November to April. These rich people never know what to do with their
      money. Such a place would give distinction to the city, and compel
      foreigners to recognize the high civilization of America. A great deal of
      fault was found with Henderson privately for his parsimony in such a
      splendid opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless it was already one of the sights of the town. Strangers were
      taken to see it, as it rose in its simple grandeur. Local reporters made
      articles on the progress of the interior whenever they could get an
      entrance. It was not ornate enough to please, generally, but those who
      admired the old Louvre liked the simplicity of its lines and the dignity
      of the elevations. They discovered the domestic note in its quiet
      character, and said that the architect had avoided the look of an
      &ldquo;institution&rdquo; in such a great mass. He was not afraid of dignified wall
      space, and there was no nervous anxiety manifested, which would have
      belittled it with trivial ornamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was not an American structure, although one could find in it
      all the rare woods and stones of the continent. Great numbers of foreign
      workmen were employed in its finishing and decoration. One could wander in
      it from Pompeii to Japan, from India to Versailles, from Greece to the
      England of the Tudors, from the Alhambra to colonial Salem. It was so
      cosmopolitan that a representative of almost any nationality, ancient or
      modern, could have been suited in it with an apartment to his taste, and
      if the interior lacked unity it did not lack a display of variety that
      appealed to the imagination. From time to time paragraphs appeared in
      English, French, and Italian journals, regarding the work of this and that
      famous artist who was designing a set of furniture or furnishing the
      drawings of a room, or carving the paneling and statuary, or painting the
      ceiling of an apartment in the great Palazzo Henderson in New York&mdash;Washington.
      The United American Workers (who were half foreigners by birth) passed
      resolutions denouncing Henderson for employing foreign pauper labor, and
      organized more than one strike while the house was building. It was very
      unpatriotic and un-American to have anything done that could not be done
      by a member of the Union. There was a firm of excellent stone-cutters
      which offered to make all the statuary needed in the house, and set it up
      in good shape, and when the offer was declined, it memorialized Congress
      for protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Henderson gave what time he could spare to the design and
      erection of the building, it pleased him to call it Margaret&rsquo;s house, and
      to see the eagerness with which she entered into its embellishment. There
      was something humorous in the enlargement of her ideas since the days when
      she had wondered at the magnificence of the Washington Square home, and
      modestly protested against its luxury. Her own boudoir was a cheap affair
      compared with that in the new house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, dear,&rdquo; she said, puzzling over the drawings, &ldquo;that it
      would better be all sandalwood? I hate mosaics. It looks so cheap to have
      little bits of precious woods stuck about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so. But what do you do with the ebony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the ebony and gold? That is the adjoining sitting-room&mdash;such a
      pretty contrast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the teak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has such a beautiful polish. That is another room. Carmen says that
      will be our sober room, where we go when we want to repent of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you have any sandal-wood left over, you can work it into your
      Boys&rsquo; Lodging-house, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish! And then the ballroom, ninety feet long&mdash;it looks
      small on the paper. And do you think we&rsquo;d better have those life-size
      figures all round, mediaeval statues, with the incandescents? Carmen says
      she would prefer a row of monks&mdash;something piquant about that in a
      ballroom. I don&rsquo;t know that I like the figures, after all; they are too
      crushing and heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would make a good room for the Common Council,&rdquo; Henderson suggested.
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be prettier hung with silken arras figured with a chain of
      dancing-girls? Dear me, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Rodney, you must put your
      mind on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might line it with gold plate. I&rsquo;ll make arrangements so that you can
      draw on the Bank of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret looked hurt. &ldquo;But you told me, dear, not to spare anything&mdash;that
      we would have the finest house in the city. I&rsquo;m sure I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t enjoy it
      unless you want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I want it,&rdquo; resumed Henderson, good-humoredly. &ldquo;Go ahead, little
      wife. We shall pull through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Women beat me,&rdquo; Henderson confessed to Uncle Jerry next day. &ldquo;They are
      the most economical of beings and the most extravagant. I&rsquo;ve got to look
      round for an extra million somewhere today.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is this good thing about women,&rdquo; Uncle Jerry responded, with a
      twinkle in his eyes, &ldquo;they share your riches just as cheerfully as they do
      your poverty. I tell Maria that if I had the capacity for making money
      that she has for spending it I could assume the national debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To have the finest house in the city, or rather, in the American newspaper
      phrase, in the Western world, was a comprehensible ambition for Henderson,
      for it was a visible expression of his wealth and his cultivated taste.
      But why Margaret should wish to exchange her dainty and luxurious home in
      Washington Square for the care of a vast establishment big enough for a
      royal court, my wife could not comprehend. But why not? To be the visible
      leader in her world, to be able to dispense a hospitality which should
      surpass anything heretofore seen, to be the mistress and autocrat of an
      army of servants, with ample room for their evolution, in a palace whose
      dimensions and splendor should awaken envy and astonishment&mdash;would
      this not be an attraction to a woman of imagination and spirit?
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, they had outgrown the old house. There was no longer room for the
      display, scarcely for the storage, of the works of art, the pictures, the
      curiosities, the books, that unlimited money and the opportunity of
      foreign travel had collected in all these years. &ldquo;We must either build or
      send our things to a warehouse,&rdquo; Henderson had long ago said. Among the
      obligations of wealth is the obligation of display. People of small means
      do not allow for the expansion of mind that goes along with the
      accumulation of property. It was only natural that Margaret, who might
      have been contented with two rooms and a lean-to as the wife of a country
      clergyman, should have felt cramped in her old house, which once seemed a
      world too large for the country girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you could do with less room,&rdquo; Carmen said, with an air of
      profound conviction. They were looking about the house on its last
      uninhabited day, directing the final disposition of its contents. For
      Carmen, as well as for Margaret, the decoration and the furnishing of the
      house had been an occupation. The girl had the whim of playing the part of
      restrainer and economizer in everything; but Henderson used to say, when
      Margaret told him of Carmen&rsquo;s suggestions, that a little more of her
      economy would ruin him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Margaret admitted, &ldquo;there does not seem to be anything that is not
      necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing. When you think of it, two people require as much space as a
      dozen; when you go beyond one room, you must go on. Of course you couldn&rsquo;t
      get on without a reception-room, drawing-rooms, a conservatory, a
      music-room, a library, a morning-room, a breakfast-room, a small
      dining-room and a state dining-room, Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s snuggery, with his
      own library, a billiard-room, a picture-gallery&mdash;it is full already;
      you&rsquo;ll have to extend it or sell some pictures&mdash;your own suite and
      Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s suite, and the guest-rooms, and I forgot the theatre in
      the attic. I don&rsquo;t see but you have scrimped to the last degree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet there is room to move about,&rdquo; Margaret acknowledged, with a
      gratified smile, as they wandered around. &ldquo;Dear me, I used to think the
      Stotts&rsquo; house was a palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the height of the season before Lent. There had been one delay and
      another, but at last all the workmen had been expelled, and Margaret was
      mistress of her house. Cards for the house-warming had been out for two
      weeks, and the event was near. She was in her own apartments this pale,
      wintry afternoon, putting the finishing touches to her toilet. Nothing seemed
      to suit. The maid found her in a very bad humor. &ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; she had said
      to her husband, when he ordered his brougham after breakfast, &ldquo;sharp
      seven, we are to dine alone the first time.&rdquo; It lacked two hours yet of
      dinner-time, but she was dressing for want of other occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this then the summit of her ambition? She had indeed looked forward to
      some such moment as this as one of exultation in the satisfaction of all
      her wishes. She took up a book of apothegms that lay on the table, and
      opened by chance to this, &ldquo;Unhappy are they whose desires are all
      ratified.&rdquo; It was like a sting. Why should she think at this moment of her
      girlhood; of the ideals indulged in during that quiet time; of her aunt&rsquo;s
      cheerful, tender, lonely life; of her rejection of Mr. Lyon? She did not
      love Mr. Lyon; she was not satisfied then. How narrow that little life in
      Brandon had been! She threw the book from her. She hated all that
      restraint and censoriousness. If her aunt could see her in all this
      splendor, she would probably be sadder than ever. What right had she to
      sit there and mourn&mdash;as she knew her aunt did&mdash;and sigh over her
      career? What right had they to sit in judgment on her?
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out from her room, down the great stairway, into the spacious
      house, pausing in the great hall to see opening vista after vista in the
      magnificent apartments. It was the first time that she had alone really
      taken the full meaning of it&mdash;had possessed it with the eye. It was
      hers. Wherever she went, all hers. No, she had desires yet. It should be
      filled with life&mdash;it should be the most brilliant house in the world.
      Society should see, should acknowledge the leadership. Yes&mdash;as she
      glanced at herself in a drawing-room mirror&mdash;they should see that
      Henderson&rsquo;s wife was capable of a success equal to his own, and she would
      stop the hateful gossip about him. She set her foot firmly as she thought
      about it; she would crush those people who had sneered at them as parvenu.
      She strayed into the noble gallery. Some face there touched her, some
      landscape soothed her. No, she said to herself, I will win them, I do not
      want hateful strife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who knows what is in a woman? how many moods in a quarter of an hour, and
      which is the characteristic one? Was this the Margaret who had walked with
      Lyon that Sunday afternoon of the baptism, and had a heart full of pain
      for the pitiful suffering of the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      As she sat there she grew calmer. Her thoughts went away in a vision of
      all the social possibilities of this wonderful house. From vaguely
      admiring what she looked at, she began to be critical; this and that could
      be changed to advantage; this shade of hanging was not harmonious; this
      light did not fall right. She smiled to think that her husband thought it
      all done. How he would laugh to find that she was already planning to
      rearrange it! Hadn&rsquo;t she been satisfied for almost twenty-four hours? That
      was a long time for a woman. Then she thought of the reception; of the
      guests; of what some of them would wear; how they would look about; what
      they would say. She was already in that world which was so shining and
      shifting and attractive. She did not hear Henderson come in until his arm
      was around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sweet, keeping house alone? I&rsquo;ve had a jolly day; lucky as old Mr.
      Luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; she cried, springing up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad. Come, see the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look a little pale,&rdquo; he said, as they strolled out to the
      conservatory together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little tired,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;Do you know, Rodney, I hated this
      house at five o&rsquo;clock&mdash;positively hated it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; I was thinking. But I liked it at half-past six. I love
      it now. I&rsquo;ve got used to it, as if I had always lived here. Isn&rsquo;t it
      beautiful everywhere? But I&rsquo;m going to make some changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hanging garden on the roof?&rdquo; Henderson asked, with meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be nice. No, not now. But to make over and take off the new
      look. Everything looks so new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we will try to live that down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they wandered on, admiring, bantering, planning. Could Etienne
      Debree have seen his descendant at this moment he would have been more
      than ever proud of his share in establishing the great republic, and of
      his appreciation of the promise of its beauty. What satisfies a woman&rsquo;s
      heart is luxury, thought Henderson, in an admiring cynical moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come into his own den and library, and he stood looking at the
      rows of his favorite collection shining in their new home. For all its
      newness it had a familiar look. He thought for a moment that he might be
      in his old bachelor quarters. Suddenly Margaret made a rush at him. She
      shook the great fellow. She feasted her eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s got into you to look so splendid? Do you hear, go this instant and
      dress, and make yourself ten times as fascinating.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Live not unto yourselves! Can any one deny that this blessed sentiment is
      extending in modern life? Do we build houses for ourselves or for others?
      Do we make great entertainments for our own comfort? I do not know that
      anybody regarded the erection of the Henderson palace as an altruistic
      performance. The socialistic newspapers said that it was pure ostentation.
      But had it not been all along in the minds of the builders to ask all the
      world to see it, to share the delight of it? Is this a selfish spirit?
      When I stroll in the Park am I not pleased with the equipages, with the
      display of elegance upon which so much money has been lavished for my
      enjoyment?
    </p>
    <p>
      All the world was asked to the Henderson reception. The coming event was
      the talk of the town. I have now cuttings from the great journals,
      articles describing the house, more beautifully written than Gibbon&rsquo;s
      stately periods about the luxury of later Rome. It makes one smile to hear
      that the day of fine writing is over. Everybody was eager to go; there was
      some plotting to obtain invitations by those who felt that they could not
      afford to be omitted from the list that would be printed; by those who did
      not know the Hendersons, and did not care to know them, but who shared the
      general curiosity; and everybody vowed that he supposed he must go, but he
      hated such a crush and jam as it was sure to be. Yet no one would have
      cared to go if it had not promised to be a crush. I said that all the
      world was asked, which is our way of saying that a thousand or two had
      been carefully selected from the million within reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invitations came to Brandon, of course, for old times&rsquo; sake. The Morgans
      said that they preferred a private view; Miss Forsythe declared that she
      hadn&rsquo;t the heart to go; in short, Mr. and Mrs. Fairchild alone went to
      represent the worldly element.

      I am sorry to say that the reader must go to the files of the city press
      for an account of the night&rsquo;s festivity. The pen that has been used in
      portraying Margaret&rsquo;s career is entirely inadequate to it. There is a
      general impression that an American can do anything that he sets his hand
      to, but it is not true; it is true only that he tries everything. The
      reporter is born, as the poet is; it cannot be acquired&mdash;that
      astonishing, irresponsible command of the English language; that warm,
      lyrical tone; that color, and bewildering metaphorical brilliancy; that
      picturesqueness; that use of words as the painter uses pigments, in
      splashes and blotches which are so effective; that touch of raillery and
      sarcasm and condescension; that gay enjoyment of reveling in the
      illimitable; that air of superior knowledge and style; that dash of
      sentiment; that calm and somewhat haughty judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am always impressed at such an entertainment with the good-humor of the
      American people, no matter what may be the annoyance and discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the push and thrust and confusion, amid the rending of trains, the
      tearing of lace, the general crushing of costumes, there was the merriest
      persiflage, laughter, and chatter, and men and women entered into and drew
      out of the fashionable wreck in the highest spirits. For even in such a
      spacious mansion there were spots where currents met, and rooms where
      there was a fight for mere breath. It would have been a tame affair
      without this struggle. And what an epitome of life it all was! There were
      those who gave themselves up to admiration, who gushed with enthusiasm;
      there were those who had the weary air of surfeit with splendor of this
      sort; there were the bustling and volatile, who made facetious remarks,
      and treated the affair like a Fourth of July; and there were also groups
      dark and haughty, like the Stotts, who held a little aloof, and coldly
      admitted that it was most successful; it lacked je ne sais quoi, but it
      was in much better taste than they had expected. Is there something in the
      very nature of a crowd to bring out the inherent vulgarity of the
      best-bred people, so that some have doubted whether the highest
      civilization will tolerate these crushing and hilarious assemblies?
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, one could enjoy the general effect. There might be vulgar
      units, and one caught notes of talk that disenchanted, but there were so
      many women of rare and stately beauty, of exquisite loveliness, of charm
      in manner and figure&mdash;so many men of fine presence, with such an air
      of power and manly prosperity and self-reliance&mdash;I doubt if any other
      assembly in the world, undecorated by orders and uniforms, with no blazon
      of rank, would have a greater air of distinction. Looking over it from a
      landing in the great stairway that commanded vistas and ranges of the
      lofty, brilliant apartments, vivified by the throng, which seemed ennobled
      by the spacious splendor in which it moved, one would be pardoned a
      feeling of national pride in the spectacle. I drew aside to let a stately
      train of beauty and of fashion descend, and saw it sweep through the hall,
      and enter the drawing-rooms, until it was lost in a sea of shifting color.
      It was like a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the centre of all this charming plutocratic graciousness and beauty
      was Margaret&mdash;Margaret and her handsome husband. Where did the New
      Hampshire boy learn this simple dignity of bearing, this good-humored
      cordiality without condescension, this easy air of the man of the world?
      Was this the railway wrecker, the insurance manipulator, the familiar of
      Uncle Jerry, the king of the lobby, the pride and the bugaboo of Wall
      Street? Margaret was regnant. And how charmingly she received her guests!
      How well I knew that half-imperious toss of the head, and the glance of
      those level, large gray eyes, softened instantly, on recognition, into the
      sweetest smile of welcome playing about the dimple and the expressive
      mouth! What woman would not feel a little thrill of triumph? The world was
      at her feet. Why was it, I wonder, as I stood there watching the throng
      which saluted this queenly woman of the world, in an hour of supreme
      social triumph, while the notes of the distant orchestra came softly on
      the air, and the overpowering perfume of banks of flowers and tropical
      plants&mdash;why was it that I thought of a fair, simple girl, stirred
      with noble ideals, eager for the intellectual life, tender, sympathetic,
      courageous? It was Margaret Debree&mdash;how often I had seen her thus!&mdash;sitting
      on her little veranda, swinging her chip hat by the string, glowing from
      some errand in which her heart had played a much more important part than
      her purse. I caught the odor of the honeysuckle that climbed on the porch,
      and I heard the note of the robin that nested there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be in a brown study,&rdquo; said Carmen, who came up, leaning on
      the arm of the Earl of Chisholm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lost in admiration. You must make allowance, Miss Eschelle, for a
      person from the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we are all from the country. That is the beauty of it. There is Mr.
      Hollowell, used to drive a peddler&rsquo;s cart, or something of that sort, up
      in Maine, talking with Mr. Stott, whose father came in on the towpath of
      the Erie Canal. You don&rsquo;t dance? The earl has just been giving me a whirl
      in the ballroom, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to make him understand about
      democracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the earl rejoined; &ldquo;Miss Eschelle has been interpreting to me
      republican simplicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he cannot point out, Mr. Fairchild, why this is not as good as a
      reception at St. James. I suppose it&rsquo;s his politeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, it is all very charming. It must be a great thing to be the
      architect of your own fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we are all self-made,&rdquo; Carmen confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, and I get dreadfully tired of it sometimes. I have to read over the
      Declaration and look at the map of the Western country at such times. A
      body has to have something to hold on to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this seems pretty substantial,&rdquo; I said, wondering what the girl was
      driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I suppose the world looks solid from a balloon. I heard one man
      say to another just now, &lsquo;How long do you suppose Henderson will last?&rsquo; 
      Probably we shall all come down by the run together by-and-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to be on a high plane,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s the influence of the earl. But I am the most misunderstood
      of women. What I really like is simplicity. Can you have that without the
      social traditions,&rdquo; she appealed to the earl, &ldquo;such as you have in
      England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really cannot say,&rdquo; the earl replied, laughing. &ldquo;I fancied there was
      simplicity in Brandon; perhaps that was traditional.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Brandon!&rdquo; Carmen cried, &ldquo;see what Brandon does when it gets a chance.
      I assure your lordship that we used to be very simple people in New York.
      Come, let us go and tell Mrs. Henderson how delightful it all is. I&rsquo;m so
      sorry for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I moved about afterwards with my wife we heard not many comments, a
      word here and there about Henderson&rsquo;s wonderful success, a remark about
      Margaret&rsquo;s beauty, some sympathy for her in such a wearisome ordeal&mdash;the
      world is full of kindness&mdash;the house duly admired, and the ordinary
      compliments paid; the people assembled were, as usual, absorbed in their
      own affairs. From all we could gather, all those present were used to
      living in a palace, and took all the splendor quite as a matter of course.
      Was there no envy? Was there nothing said about the airs of a country
      school-ma&rsquo;am, the aplomb of an adventurer? Were there no criticisms
      afterwards as the guests rolled home in their carriages, surfeited and
      exhausted? What would you have? Do you expect the millennium to begin in
      New York?
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspapers said that it was the most brilliant affair the metropolis
      had ever seen. I have no doubt it was. And I do not judge, either, by the
      newspaper estimates of the expense. I take the simple words addressed by
      the earl to Margaret, when he said good-night, at their full value. She
      flushed with pleasure at his modest commendation. Perhaps it was to her
      the seal of her night&rsquo;s triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was opened. The world had seen it. The world had gone. If sleep
      did not come that night to her tired head on the pillow, what wonder? She
      had a position in the great world. In imagination it opened wider and
      wider. Could not the infinite possibilities of it fill the hunger of any
      soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      The echoes of the Henderson reception continued long in the country press.
      Items multiplied as to the cost. It was said that the sum expended in
      flowers alone, which withered in a night, would have endowed a ward in a
      charity hospital. Some wag said that the price of the supper would have
      changed the result of the Presidential election. Views of the mansion were
      given in the illustrated papers, and portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Henderson.
      In country villages, in remote farmhouses, this great social event was
      talked of, Henderson&rsquo;s wealth was the subject of conjecture, Margaret&rsquo;s
      toilet was an object of interest. It was a shining example of success.
      Preachers, whose sensational sermons are as widely read as descriptions of
      great crimes, moralized on Henderson&rsquo;s career and Henderson&rsquo;s palace, and
      raised up everywhere an envied image of worldly prosperity. When he first
      arrived in New York, with only fifty cents in his pocket&mdash;so the
      story ran-and walked up Broadway and Fifth Avenue, he had nearly been run
      over at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street by a carriage, the occupants of
      which, a lady and gentleman, had stared insolently at the country youth.
      Never mind, said the lad to himself, the day will come when you will
      cringe to me. And the day did come when the gentleman begged Henderson to
      spare him in Wall Street, and his wife intrigued for an invitation to Mrs.
      Henderson&rsquo;s ball. The reader knows there is not a word of truth in this.
      Alas! said the preacher, if he had only devoted his great talents to the
      service of the Good and the True! Behold how vain are all the triumphs of
      this world! see the result of the worship of Mammon! My friends, the age
      is materialized, a spirit of worldliness is abroad; be vigilant, lest the
      deceitfulness of riches send your souls to perdition. And the plain
      country people thanked God for such a warning, and the country girl
      dreamed of Margaret&rsquo;s career, and the country boy studied the ways of
      Henderson&rsquo;s success, and resolved that he, too, would seek his fortune in
      this bad metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hendersons were important people. It was impossible that a knowledge
      of their importance should not have a reflex influence upon Margaret.
      Could it be otherwise than that gradually the fineness of her
      discrimination should be dulled by the almost universal public consent in
      the methods by which Henderson had achieved his position, and that in time
      she should come to regard adverse judgment as the result of envy?
      Henderson himself was under less illusion; the world was about what he had
      taken it for, only a little worse&mdash;more gullible, and with less
      principle. Carmen had mocked at Margaret&rsquo;s belief in Henderson. It is
      certainly a pitiful outcome that Margaret, with her naturally believing
      nature, should in the end have had a less clear perception of what was
      right and wrong than Henderson himself. Yet Henderson would not have
      shrunk, any more than Carmen would, from any course necessary to his ends,
      while Margaret would have shrunk from many things; but in absolute
      worldliness, in devotion to it, the time had come when Henderson felt that
      his Puritan wife was no restraint upon him. It was this that broke gentle
      Miss Forsythe&rsquo;s heart when she came fully to realize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said that the world was at Margaret&rsquo;s feet. Was it? How many worlds are
      there, and does one ever, except by birth (in a republic), conquer them
      all? Truth to say, there were penetralia in New York society concerning
      which this successful woman was uneasy in her heart. There were people who
      had accepted her invitations, to whose houses she had been, who had a
      dozen ways of making her feel that she was not of them. These people&mdash;I
      suppose that if two castaways landed naked on a desert island, one of them
      would instantly be the ancien regime&mdash;had spoken of Mrs. Henderson
      and her ambition to the Earl of Chisholm in a way that pained him. They
      graciously assumed that he, as one of the elect, would understand them. It
      was therefore with a heavy heart that he came to say good-by to Margaret
      before his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot imagine anything more uncomfortable for an old lover than a
      meeting of this sort; but I suppose the honest fellow could not resist the
      inclination to see Margaret once more. I dare say she had a little flutter
      of pride in receiving him, in her consciousness of the change in herself
      into a wider experience of the world. And she may have been a little
      chagrined that he was not apparently more impressed by her surroundings,
      nor noticed the change in herself, but met her upon the ground of simple
      sincerity where they had once stood. What he tried to see, what she felt
      he was trying to see, was not the beautiful woman about whose charm and
      hospitality the town talked, but the girl he had loved in the old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked a little, a very little, about himself and his work in England,
      and a great deal about what had interested him here on his second visit,
      the social drift, the politics, the organized charities; and as he talked,
      Margaret was conscious how little the world in which she lived seemed to
      interest him; how little importance he attached to it. And she saw, as in
      a momentary vision of herself, that the things that once absorbed her and
      stirred her sympathies were now measurably indifferent to her. Book after
      book which he casually mentioned, as showing the drift of the age, and
      profoundly affecting modern thought, she knew only by name. &ldquo;I guess,&rdquo;
       said Carmen, afterwards, when Margaret spoke of the earl&rsquo;s conversation,
      &ldquo;that he is one of those who are trying to live in the spirit&mdash;what
      do they call it?&mdash;care for things of the mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doing a noble work,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in your Palace of Industry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is very well managed,&rdquo; Margaret replied; &ldquo;but it is uphill work,
      the poor are so ungrateful for charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps nobody, Mrs. Henderson, likes to be treated as an object of
      charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, work isn&rsquo;t what they want when we give it, and they&rsquo;d rather live
      in the dirt than in clean apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many of them don&rsquo;t know any better, and a good many of our poor resent
      condescension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Margaret, with warmth; &ldquo;they are getting to demand things as
      their right, and they are insolent. The last time I drove down in that
      quarter I was insulted by their manner. What are you going to do with such
      people? One big fellow who was leaning against a lamp-post growled, &lsquo;You&rsquo;d
      better stay in your own palace, miss, and not come prying round here.&rsquo; And
      a brazen girl cried out: &lsquo;Shut yer mouth, Dick; the lady&rsquo;s got to have
      some pleasure. Don&rsquo;t yer see, she&rsquo;s a-slummin&rsquo;?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard, I know,&rdquo; said the earl; &ldquo;perhaps we are all on the wrong
      track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe. Mr. Henderson says that the world would get on better if everybody
      minded his own business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were possible,&rdquo; the earl remarked, with an air of finishing the
      topic. &ldquo;I have just been up to Brandon, Mrs. Henderson. I fear that I have
      seen the dear place for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you are tired of America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that. I shall never, even in thought, tire of Brandon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are dear, good people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought Miss Forsythe&mdash;what a sweet, brave woman she is!&mdash;was
      looking sad and weary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, aunt won&rsquo;t do anything, or take an interest in anything. She just
      stays there. I&rsquo;ve tried in vain to get her here. Do you know&rdquo;&mdash;and
      she turned upon the earl a look of the old playfulness&mdash;&ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t
      quite approve of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he replied, hesitating a little&mdash;&ldquo;I think, Mrs. Henderson, that
      her heart is bound up in you. It isn&rsquo;t for me to say that you haven&rsquo;t a
      truer friend in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. If I&rsquo;d only&mdash;&rdquo; and she stopped, with a petulant look on
      her fair face&mdash;&ldquo;well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. She is a dear soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;suppose,&rdquo; said the earl, rising, &ldquo;we shall see you again on the
      other side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; with a smile. Could anything be more commonplace than such a
      parting? Good-by, I shall see you tomorrow or next year, or in the next
      world. Hail and farewell! That is the common experience. But, oh, the
      bitterness of it to many a soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite possible that when the Earl of Chisholm said good-by, with an
      air of finality, Margaret felt that another part of her life was closed.
      He was not in any way an extraordinary person, he was not a very rich
      peer, probably with his modesty and conscientiousness, and devotion to the
      ordinary duties of his station, he would never attain high rank in the
      government. Yet no one could be long with him without apprehending that
      his life was on a high plane. It was with a little irritation that
      Margaret recognized this, and remembered, with a twinge of conscience,
      that it was upon that plane that her life once traveled. The time had been
      when the more important thing to her was the world of ideas, of books, of
      intellectual life, of passionate sympathy with the fortunes of humanity,
      of deepest interest in all the new thoughts struck out by the leaders who
      studied the profound problems of life and destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      That peace of mind which is found only in the highest activity for the
      noblest ends she once had, though she thought it then unrest and striving&mdash;what
      Carmen, who was under no illusions about Henderson, or Uncle Jerry, or the
      world of fashion, and had an intuitive perception of cant that is
      sometimes denied to the children of light, called &ldquo;taking pleasure in the
      things of the mind.&rdquo; To do Margaret justice, there entered into her
      reflections no thought of the title and position of the Earl of Chisholm.
      They had never been alluring to her. If one could take any satisfaction in
      this phase of her character, her worldiness was purely American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly know which I should prefer,&rdquo; Carmen was saying when they were
      talking over the ball and the earl&rsquo;s departure, &ldquo;to be an English countess
      or the wife of an American millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might depend upon the man,&rdquo; replied Margaret, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The American,&rdquo; continued Carmen, not heeding this suggestion, &ldquo;has the
      greater opportunities, and is not hindered by traditions. If you were a
      countess you would have to act like a countess. If you are an American you
      can act&mdash;like anything&mdash;you can do what you please. That is
      nicer. Now, an earl must do what an earl has always done. What could you
      do with such a husband? Mind! Yes, I know, dear, about things of the mind.
      First, you know, he will be a gentleman socialist (in the magazines), and
      maybe a Christian socialist, or a Christian scientist, or something of
      that sort, interested in the Mind Cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that would suit you. Last I knew, you were deep in the
      Mind Cure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was. That was last week. Now I&rsquo;m in the Faith Cure; I&rsquo;ve found out
      about both. The difference is, in the Mind Cure you don&rsquo;t require any
      faith; in the Faith Cure you don&rsquo;t require any mind. The Faith Cure just
      suits me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you put your faith in an American millionaire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I should, until an American millionaire put faith in me.
      That might shake me. It is such a queer world. No, I&rsquo;m in doubt. If you
      loved an earl he would stay an earl. If you loved an American millionaire,
      ten to one he would fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret did not escape the responsibility of her success. Who does? My
      dear Charmian, who wrote the successful novel of last year, do you not
      already repent your rash act? If you do not write a better novel this
      year, will not the public flout you and jeer you for a pretender? Did the
      public overpraise you at first? Its mistaken partiality becomes now your
      presumption. Last year the press said you were the rival of Hawthorne.
      This year it is, &ldquo;that Miss Charmian who set herself up as a second
      Hawthorne.&rdquo; When the new house was opened, it might be said that socially
      Mrs. Henderson had &ldquo;arrived.&rdquo; Had she? When one enters on the path of
      worldliness is there any resting-place? Is not eternal vigilance the price
      of position?
    </p>
    <p>
      Henderson was apparently on good terms with the world. Many envied him,
      many paid him the sincerest flattery, that of imitation. He was a king in
      the street, great enterprises sought his aid, all the charities knocked at
      his door, his word could organize a syndicate or a trust, his nod could
      smash a &ldquo;corner.&rdquo; There were fabulous stories about his wealth, about his
      luck. This also was Margaret&rsquo;s world. Her ambition expanded in it with
      his. The things he set his heart on she coveted. Alas! there is always
      another round to the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the means by which he gained his ends, and the public condonation
      of them, would not his cynicism harden into utter unbelief in general
      virtue and goodness? I don&rsquo;t know that Henderson changed much, accented as
      his grasping selfishness was on occasion; prosperity had not impaired that
      indifferent good-fellowship and toleration which had early gained him
      popularity. His presence was nowhere a rebuke to whatever was going on. He
      was always accessible, often jocular. The younger members in the club said
      Henderson was a devilish good fellow, whatever people said. The President
      of the United States used to send for him and consult him, because he
      wanted no office; he knew men, and it was a relief to talk with a liberal
      rich man of so much bonhomie who wanted nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret, what view of the world did all this give her? Did she come
      in contact with any one who had not his price, who was not going or
      wanting to go in the general current? Was it not natural that she should
      take Henderson&rsquo;s view? Dear me, I am not preaching about her. We did not
      see much of her in those days, and for one or two years of what I suppose
      was her greatest enjoyment of her social triumphs. So far as we heard, she
      was liked, admired, followed, envied. It could not be otherwise, for she
      did not lose her beauty nor her charm, and she tried to please. Once when
      I saw her in the city and we fell into talk&mdash;and the talk was gay
      enough and unconstrained&mdash;I was struck with a certain hardness of
      tone, a little bitterness quite unlike her old self. It is a very hard
      thing to say, and I did not say it even to my wife, but I had a painful
      impression that she was valuing people by the money they had, by the
      social position they had attained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she content in that great world in which she moved? I had heard
      stories of slights, of stabs, of rebuffs, of spiteful remarks. Had she not
      come to know how success even in social life is sometimes attained&mdash;the
      meannesses, the jealousies, the cringing? Even with all her money at
      command, did she not know that her position was at the price of incessant
      effort? Because she had taken a bold step today, she must take a bolder
      one tomorrow&mdash;more display, more servants, some new invention of
      luxury and extravagance. And seeing, as I say, the inside of this life and
      what it required, and how triumphs and notoriety were gained, was it a
      wonder that she gradually became in her gayety cynical, in her judgments
      bitter?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not criticising her. What are we, who have had no opportunities, to
      sit in judgment on her! I believe that it is true that it was at her
      solicitation that Henderson at last did endow a university in the
      Southwest. I know that her name was on all the leading charities of the
      city. I know that of all the patronesses of the charity ball her costume
      was the most exquisite, and her liberality was most spoken of. I know that
      in the most fashionable house of worship (the newspapers call it that) she
      was a constant attendant; that in her modest garb she never missed a
      Lenten service; and we heard that she performed a novena during this
      penitential season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why protract the story of how Margaret was lost to us? Could this interest
      any but us&mdash;we who felt the loss because we still loved her? And why
      should we presume to set up our standard of what is valuable in life, of
      what is a successful career? She had not become what we hoped, and little
      by little all the pleasure of intercourse on both sides, I dare say,
      disappeared. Could we say that life, after all, had not given her what she
      most desired? Rather than write on in this strain about her, I would like
      to read her story as it appeared to the companions whose pleasures were
      her pleasures, whose successes were her successes&mdash;her story written
      by one who appreciated her worldly advantages, and saw all the delight
      there was in this attractive worldliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What comfort there was in it we had in knowing that she was a favorite in
      the society of which we read such glowing descriptions, and that no one
      else bore its honors more winningly. It was not an easy life, with all its
      exactions and incessant movement. It demanded more physical strength than
      most women possess, and we were not surprised to hear from time to time
      that she was delicate, and that she went through her season with feverish
      excitement. But she chose it; it had become necessary to her. Can women
      stop in such a career, even if they wish to stop?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she chose it. I, for one, never begrudged her any pleasure she had in
      life, and I do not know but she was as happy as it is possible for human
      being to be in a full experiment of worldliness. Who is the judge? But we,
      I say, who loved her, and knew so well the noble possibilities of her
      royal nature under circumstances favorable to its development, felt more
      and more her departure from her own ideals. Her life in its spreading
      prosperity seemed more and more shallow. I do not say she was heartless, I
      do not say she was uncharitable, I do not say that in all the externals of
      worldly and religious observance she was wanting; I do not say that the
      more she was assimilated to the serenely worldly nature of her husband she
      did not love him, or that she was unlovely in the worldliness that
      ingulfed her and bore her onward. I do not know that there is anything
      singular in her history. But the pain of it to us was in the certainty&mdash;and
      it seemed so near&mdash;that in the decay of her higher life, in the
      hardening process of a material existence, in the transfer of all her
      interests to the trivial and sensuous gratifications&mdash;time, mind,
      heart, ambition, all fixed on them&mdash;we should never regain our
      Margaret. What I saw in a vision of her future was a dead soul&mdash;a
      beautiful woman in all the success of envied prosperity, with a dead soul.

    <h2>
      XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is difficult not to convey a false impression of Margaret at this time.
      Habits, manners, outward conduct&mdash;nay, the superficial kindliness in
      human intercourse, the exterior graceful qualities, may all remain when
      the character has subtly changed, when the real aims have changed, when
      the ideals are lowered. The fair exterior may be only a shell. I can
      imagine the heart retaining much tenderness and sympathy with suffering
      when the soul itself has ceased to struggle for the higher life, when the
      mind has lost, in regard to life, the final discrimination of what is
      right and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is fairer to Margaret to consider the general opinion of the
      world regarding her. No doubt, if we had now known her for the first time,
      we should have admired her exceedingly, and probably have accounted her
      thrice happy in filling so well her brilliant position. That her loss of
      interest in things intellectual, in a wide range of topics of human
      welfare, which is in the individual soul a sign of warmth and growth, made
      her less companionable to some is true, but her very absorption in the
      life of her world made her much more attractive to others. I well remember
      a dinner one day at the Hendersons&rsquo;, when Mr. Morgan and I happened to be
      in town, and the gay chat and persiflage of the society people there
      assembled. Margaret shone in it. The light and daring touch of her
      raillery Carmen herself might have envied, and the spirit in which she
      handled the trifles and personal gossip tossed to the surface, like the
      bubbles on the champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a pretty picture&mdash;the noble diningroom, the table
      sparkling with glass and silver and glowing with masses of choicest
      flowers from the conservatory, the animated convives, and Margaret
      presiding, radiant in a costume of white and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; Morgan was saying, apropos of the position of women, &ldquo;men get
      mighty little out of it in the modern arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said, Mr. Morgan,&rdquo; Margaret retorted, &ldquo;that you came into the
      world a couple of centuries too late; you ought to have been here in the
      squaw age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, men were of some account then. I appeal to Henderson,&rdquo; Morgan
      persisted, &ldquo;if he gets more than his board and clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my husband has to make his way; he&rsquo;s no time for idling and
      philosophizing round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not. Come, Henderson, speak up; what do you get out of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Henderson, glancing at his wife with an amused expression, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      doing very well. I&rsquo;m very well taken care of, but I often wonder what the
      fellows did when polygamy was the fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Polygamy, indeed!&rdquo; cried Margaret. &ldquo;So men only dropped the a pluribus
      unum method on account of the expense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Henderson. &ldquo;Women are so much better now than
      formerly that one wife is quite enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got him well in hand, Mrs. Henderson, but&mdash;&rdquo; Morgan began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Margaret for him, &ldquo;you think as things are going that
      polyandry will have to come in fashion&mdash;a woman will need more than
      one husband to support her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was born too soon,&rdquo; murmured Carmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, you&rsquo;ll have to be born again. But, Mr. Morgan, you don&rsquo;t seem
      to understand what civilization is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to. I&rsquo;ve been thinking&mdash;this is entirely impersonal&mdash;that
      it costs more to keep one fine lady going than it does a college. Just
      reckon it up.&rdquo; (Margaret was watching him with sparkling eyes.) &ldquo;The
      palace in town is for her, the house in the mountains, the house by the
      sea, are for her, the army of servants is for her, the horses and
      carriages for all weathers are for her, the opera box is for her, and then
      the wardrobe&mdash;why, half Paris lives on what women wear. I say nothing
      of what would become of the medical profession but for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you done?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;m taking breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t we support the working-people of Paris and elsewhere?
      Do you want us to make our own clothes and starve the sewing-women?
      Suppose there weren&rsquo;t any balls and fine dresses and what you call luxury.
      What would the poor do without the rich? Isn&rsquo;t it the highest charity to
      give them work? Even with it they are ungrateful enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is too deep for me,&rdquo; said Morgan, evasively. &ldquo;I suppose they ought
      to be contented to see us enjoying ourselves. It&rsquo;s all in the way of
      civilization, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as I thought,&rdquo; said Margaret, more lightly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t an
      inkling of what civilization is. See that flower before you. It is the
      most exquisite thing in this room. See the refinement of its color and
      form. That was cultivated. The plant came from South Africa. I don&rsquo;t know
      what expense the gardener has been to about it, what material and care
      have been necessary to bring it to perfection. You may take it to Mrs.
      Morgan as an object-lesson. It is a thing of beauty. You cannot put any of
      your mercantile value on it. Well, that is woman, the consummate flower of
      civilization. That is what civilization is for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you, old fellow,&rdquo; said Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for myself,&rdquo; Carmen said, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit all that,&rdquo; Morgan replied. &ldquo;Take Mr. Henderson as a gardener,
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you take somebody else, and let my husband eat his dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind preaching; I&rsquo;ve got used to being made to point a
      moral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he will go on next about the luxury of the age, and the extravagance
      of women, and goodness knows what,&rdquo; said Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m talking about men,&rdquo; Morgan continued. &ldquo;Consider Henderson&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      entirely impersonal&mdash;as a gardener. What does he get out of his
      occupation? He can look at the flower. Perhaps that is enough. He gets a
      good dinner when he has time for it, an hour at his club now and then,
      occasionally an evening or half a day off at home, a decent wardrobe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty-two suits,&rdquo; interposed Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His own brougham&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a four-in-hand,&rdquo; added Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pass on the elevated road&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a steam-yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which he never gets time to sail in; practically all the time on the
      road, or besieged by a throng in his office, hustled about from morning
      till night, begged of, interviewed, a telegraphic despatch every five
      minutes, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me!&rdquo; cried Margaret, rising. The guests all clapped their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hendersons liked to have their house full, something going on&mdash;dinners,
      musicales, readings, little comedies in the theatre; there was continual
      coming and going, calling, dropping in for a cup of tea, late suppers
      after the opera; the young fellows of town found no place so agreeable for
      a half-hour after business as Mrs. Henderson&rsquo;s reception-room. I fancied
      that life would be dull and hang heavily, especially for Margaret, without
      this perpetual movement and excitement. Henderson, who certainly had
      excitement enough without seeking it at home, was pleased that his wife
      should be a leader in society, as he was in the great enterprises in which
      his fortune waxed to enormous proportions. About what we call the home
      life I do not know. Necessarily, as heretofore, Henderson was often
      absent, and whether Margaret accompanied him or not, a certain pace of
      life had to be kept up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose there is no delusion more general than that of retiring upon a
      fortune&mdash;as if, when gained, a fortune would let a person retire, or,
      still more improbable, as if it ever were really attained. It is not at
      all probable that Henderson had set any limit to that he desired; the
      wildest speculations about its amount would no doubt fall short of
      satisfying the love of power which he expected to gratify in immeasurably
      increasing it. Does not history teach us that to be a great general, or
      poet, or philanthropist, is not more certain to preserve one&rsquo;s name than
      to be the richest man, the Croesus, in his age? I could imagine Margaret
      having a certain growing pride in this distinction, and a glowing ambition
      to be socially what her husband was financially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven often plans more mercifully for us than we plan for ourselves. Had
      not the Hebrew prophets a vision of the punishment by prosperity? Perhaps
      it applied to an old age, gratified to the end by possession of everything
      that selfishness covets, and hardened into absolute worldliness. I knew
      once an old lady whose position and wealth had always made her envied, and
      presumably happy, who was absolutely to be pitied for a soul empty of all
      noble feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun still shone on Margaret, and life yielded to her its specious
      sweets. She was still young. If in her great house, in her dazzling
      career, in the whirl of resplendent prosperity, she had hours of
      unsatisfied yearning for something unattainable in this direction, the
      world would not have guessed it. Whenever we heard of her she was the
      centre and star of whatever for the moment excited the world of fashion.
      It was indeed, at last, in the zenith of her gay existence that I, became
      aware of a certain feminine anxiety about her in our neighborhood. She had
      been, years before, very ill in Paris, and the apprehensions for her
      safety now were based upon the recollection of her peril then. The days
      came when the tender-hearted Miss Forsythe went about the house restless,
      impatient, tearful, waiting for a summons that was sure to come when she
      was needed. She thought only of her child, as she called her, and all the
      tenderness of her nature was stirred-these years of cloud and separation
      and pain were as they had not been. Little Margaret had promised to send
      for her. She would not obtrude before she was wanted, but Margaret was
      certain to send. And she was ready for departure the instant the despatch
      came from Henderson&mdash;&ldquo;Margaret wants you to come at once.&rdquo; I went
      with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In calamity, trouble, sorrow, it is wonderful how the ties of blood assert
      themselves. In this hour I am sure that Margaret longed for no one more
      than her dear aunt, in whose arms, as a child, she had so often forgotten
      her griefs. She had been able to live without her&mdash;nay, for a long
      time her presence had been something of a restraint and a rebuke, and her
      feelings had hardened towards her. Why is it that the heart hardens in
      prosperity?
    </p>
    <p>
      When we arrived Margaret was very ill. The house itself had a serious air:
      it was no longer the palace of festivity and gayety, precautions had been
      taken to secure quiet, the pavement was littered, and within the hushed
      movements and the sombre looks spoke of apprehension and the absence of
      the spirit that had been the life and light of the house. Our arrival
      seemed to be a relief to Henderson. Little was said. I had never before
      seen him nervous, never before so restless and anxious, probably never
      before in all his career had he been unnerved with a sense of his own
      helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been asking for you this moment,&rdquo; he said, as he accompanied Miss
      Forsythe to Margaret&rsquo;s apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear aunt, I knew you would come&mdash;I love you so;&rdquo; she had
      tried to raise herself a little in her bed, and was sobbing like a child
      in her aunt&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have courage, Margaret; it will all be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m so discouraged; I&rsquo;m so tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vigil began. The nurses were in waiting. The family physician would
      not leave the house. He was a man of great repute in his profession. Dr.
      Seftel&rsquo;s name was well known to me, but I had never met him before; a man
      past middle life, smooth shaven, thin iron-gray hair, grave, usually
      taciturn, deliberate in all his movements, as if every gesture were
      important and significant, but with a kindly face. Knowing that every
      moment of his waking life was golden, I could not but be impressed with
      the power that could command his exclusive service for an indefinite time.
      When he came down, we talked together in Henderson&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a question of endurance, of constitution,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;many weak
      women have this quality of persistence; many strong women go to pieces at
      once; we know little about it. Mrs. Henderson&rdquo;&mdash;glancing about him&mdash;&ldquo;has
      everything to live for; that&rsquo;s in her favor. I suppose there are not two
      other men in the country whose fortune equals Henderson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not know how it was, probably the patient was not forgotten, but in a
      moment the grave doctor was asking me if I had seen the last bulletin
      about the yacht regatta. He took the keenest interest in the contest, and
      described to me the build and sailing qualities of the different yachts
      entered, and expressed his opinion as to which would win, and why. From
      this he passed to the city government and the recent election&mdash;like a
      true New Yorker, his chief interest centred in the city politics and not
      in the national elections. Without the least unbending from his dignity,
      he told me many anecdotes about city politicians, which would have been
      amusing if I had not been anxious about other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon passed, and the night, and the day, I cannot tell how. But
      at evening I knew by the movements in the house that the crisis had come.
      I was waiting in Henderson&rsquo;s library. An hour passed, when Henderson came
      hurrying in, pale, excited, but joyous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it is a boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Margaret?&rdquo; I gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is doing very well!&rdquo; He touched a bell, and gave an order to the servant.
      &ldquo;We will drink to the dear girl and to the heir of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was in great spirits. The doctor joined us, but I noticed that he was
      anxious, and he did not stay long. Henderson was in and out, talking,
      excited, restless. But everything was going very well, he thought. At
      last, as we sat talking, a servant appeared at the door, with a frightened
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The baby, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! there had been an heir of the house of Henderson for just two hours;
      and Margaret was not sustaining herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why go on? Henderson was beside himself; stricken with grief, enraged, I
      believe, as well, at the thought of his own impotence. Messengers were
      despatched, a consultation was called. The best skill of the city, at any
      cost, was at Margaret&rsquo;s bedside. Was there anything, then, that money
      could not do? How weak we are!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the patient was no better, she was evidently sinking. The
      news went swiftly round the city. It needed a servant constantly at the
      door to answer the stream of sympathetic inquirers. Reporters were
      watching the closed house from the opposite pavement. I undertook to
      satisfy some of them who gained the steps and came forward, civil enough
      and note-books in hand, when the door was opened. This intrusion of
      curiosity seemed so dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great house was silent. How vain and empty and pitiful it all seemed
      as I wandered alone through the gorgeous apartments! What a mockery it all
      was of the tragedy impending above-stairs&mdash;the approach on list-shod
      feet of the great enemy! Let us not be unjust. He would have come just the
      same if his prey had lain in a farmhouse among the hills, or in a
      tenement-house in C Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day and a night, and another day&mdash;and then! It was Miss Forsythe
      who came down to me, with strained eyes and awe in her face. It needed no
      words. She put her face upon my shoulder, and sobbed as if her heart were
      broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not stay in the house. I went out into the streets, the streets
      brilliant in the sun of an autumn day, into the town, gay, bustling,
      crowded, pulsing with vigorous life. How blue the sky was! The sparrows
      twittered in Madison Square, the idlers sat in the sun, the children
      chased their hoops about the fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wandered into the club. The news had preceded me there. More than one
      member in the reading-room grasped my hand, with just a word of sympathy.
      Two young fellows, whom I had last seen at the Henderson dinner, were
      seated at a small table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rough, Jack&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker paused, with a match in his hand&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      rough. I&rsquo;ll be if she was not the finest woman I ever knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My wife and I were sitting in the orchestra stalls of the Metropolitan.
      The opera was Siegfried. At the close of the first act, as we turned to
      the house, we saw Carmen enter a box, radiant, in white. Henderson
      followed, and took a seat a little in shadow behind her. There were others
      in the box. There was a little movement and flutter as they came in and
      glasses were turned that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married, and it is only two years,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only a year and eight months,&rdquo; my wife replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the world goes on as cheerfully and prosperously as ever.
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
